Du Mont.\r\n\r\nThis e-text contains the 167 chess and checkers board game\r\ndiagrams appearing in the original book, all in the form of\r\nASCII line drawings. The following is a key to the diagrams:\r\n\r\nFor chess pieces,\r\n\r\n  R  =  Rook\r\n  Kt =  Knight\r\n  B  =  Bishop\r\n  Q  =  Queen\r\n  K  =  King\r\n  P  =  Pawn\r\n\r\nBlack pieces have a # symbol to the left of them, while\r\nwhite pieces have a ^ symbol to the left of them. For example,\r\n#B is the Black bishop, while ^B is the white bishop. #Kt is\r\nthe black knight, while ^Kt is the white knight. This will\r\nlet the reader instantly tell by sight which pieces in the\r\nASCII chess diagrams are black and which are white. Those\r\nwho find these diagrams hard to read should feel free\r\nto set up them up on a game board using the actual pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nI.

Irregular Openings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the first edition of Edward Lasker’s _Chess Strategy_ was\r\nexhausted within a comparatively short time of its appearance,\r\nthe author set himself the task of altering and improving the\r\nwork to such an extent that it became to all intents and purposes\r\na new book. I had the privilege of co-operating with him to a\r\nslight degree on that second edition, and was in consequence able\r\nto appreciate the tremendous amount of work he voluntarily took\r\nupon himself to do; I say voluntarily, because his publishers,\r\nanxious to supply the strong demand for the book, wished to\r\nreprint it as it stood.\r\n\r\nA little later I undertook to translate this second edition into\r\nEnglish for Messrs. Bell \u0026 Sons. Only a few months had elapsed,\r\nthe tournaments at Petrograd, Chester, and Mannheim had taken\r\nplace, several new discoveries had been made, and it is the\r\ngreatest testimony to Edward Lasker’s indefatigable devotion to\r\nthe Art of Chess that I am able to say that this is not a\r\ntranslation of the second edition, but of what is practically a\r\nnew book. It contains a new preface, a chapter for beginners, a\r\nnew introduction, new variations.  Furthermore, a large number of\r\nnew games have taken the place of old ones.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that any chess player who will take the trouble\r\nto study _Chess Strategy_ will spend many a pleasurable hour.\r\nIncidentally new vistas will be opened to him, and his playing\r\nstrength increased to a surprising degree.\r\n\r\nThe author says in his preface that he appeals to the\r\nintelligence and not the memory of his readers. In my opinion,\r\ntoo, the student should above all try to improve his judgment of\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThan the playing over of games contested by experts I can hardly\r\nimagine a greater or purer form of enjoyment.  Yet I must at the\r\noutset sound a note of warning against its being done\r\nsuperficially, and with a feverish expectation of something\r\nhappening. Every move or combination of moves should be carefully\r\nweighed, and the student should draw his own conclusions and\r\ncompare them with what actually happens in the game under\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThis applies particularly to some of the critical positions set\r\nout in diagrams in the course of the exposition of the several\r\ngames.\r\n\r\nThe reader would derive the greatest possible benefit from a\r\nprolonged study of such positions before seeking to know how the\r\ngames proceed. After having formed his own opinion about the\r\nmerits of a particular position, he should compare the result\r\nwith the sequel in the game in question, and thus find out where\r\nhis judgment has been at fault.\r\n\r\nThe deeper study of the theory of the openings is of course a\r\nnecessity to the student who wishes to become an expert, but the\r\ndevelopment of his judgment must precede it. To him Griffith \u0026\r\nWhite’s admirable book, _Modern Chess Openings_, will be a perfect\r\nmine of information. There are thousands of variations, and in\r\nmost of them the actual game in which they were first tried by\r\nmasters is named, thus adding to the interest and value of the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nI must not omit to mention the invaluable help afforded me by my\r\nfriend Mr. John Hart, to whom my warmest thanks are due.\r\n\r\nJULIUS DU MONT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR’S PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe large majority of chess players who would like to improve\r\ntheir game, have not the necessary opportunity of pitting\r\nthemselves against players of master-strength, or at least of\r\nobtaining the desired instruction from personal intercourse with\r\nthem. It is for such players that the present work is intended.\r\nThe books on which the learner has to rely hardly ever serve his\r\npurpose, being mostly little more than a disjointed tabulation of\r\nnumberless opening variations, which cannot be understood without\r\npreliminary studies, and consequently only make for confusion. In\r\nthe end the connection between the various lines of play may\r\nbecome clear, after the student has made an exhaustive study of\r\nthe subject, but very few would have either the time or the\r\ninclination for such prolonged labour.\r\n\r\nTherefore another shorter and less empirical way must be found in\r\nwhich to acquire the understanding of sound play. My system of\r\nteaching differs from the usual ones, in that it sets down at the\r\noutset definite elementary principles of chess strategy by which\r\nany move can be gauged at its true value, thus enabling the\r\nlearner to form his own judgment as to the manœuvres under\r\nconsideration. In my opinion it is absolutely _essential_ to follow\r\nsuch strategical principles, and I go so far as to assert that\r\nsuch principles are in themselves _sufficient_ for the development\r\nand conduct of a correct game of chess.\r\n\r\nEven though instruction in chess is possible on very general\r\nlines alone, yet I think it advisable and indeed necessary to\r\nexplain the application of such principles to the various phases\r\nof each game of chess. Otherwise the learner might unduly delay\r\nhis progress, and lose valuable time in finding out for himself\r\ncertain essentials that could more profitably be pointed out to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the way in which I have arranged my subject and\r\nthe form of its exposition in detail, I have thought out the\r\nfollowing plan.\r\n\r\nAfter discussing at length the leading principles underlying\r\nsound play, I have first treated of the _openings_, in which such\r\nprinciples are of even more deciding influence than in any other\r\nstage of the game, as far as could be done on broad lines without\r\nhaving to pay attention to middle and end-game considerations.\r\n\r\nI proceeded as follows, by taking as my starting-point the  “pawn\r\nskeleton” which is formed in the opening, and round which the\r\npieces should group themselves in logical fashion.  As a\r\nconsequence of the pawns having so little mobility, this  “pawn\r\nskeleton” often preserves its shape right into the end-game.\r\nApplying the general strategical principles to the formation of\r\nthe pawn skeleton, the learner acquires the understanding of the\r\nleading idea underlying each opening without having to burden his\r\nmemory. Not only that, he will also be able to find a correct\r\nplan of development when confronted with unusual forms of\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nThe most important result of this system of teaching is that the\r\nlearner does not lose his way in a maze of detail, but has in\r\nview at the very outset, the goal which the many possible\r\nvariations of the openings are intended to reach.\r\n\r\nBefore I could proceed to the discussion of the middle game, I found it\r\nnecessary to treat of the principles governing the _end-game_. For in\r\nmost cases play in the middle game is influenced by end-game\r\nconsiderations. Here also it has been my endeavour as far as possible\r\nto reduce my subject to such principles as are generally applicable.\r\n\r\nFinally, as regards the middle game_, to which the whole of Part\r\nII is devoted, I have again made the handling of pawns, the\r\nhardest of all problems of strategy, the starting-point for my\r\ndeliberations. I have shown at length how the various plans\r\ninitiated by the various openings should be developed further. To\r\nensure a thorough understanding of the middle game, I have given\r\na large number of games taken from master play, with numerous and\r\nextensive notes. Thus the student has not to rely only on\r\nexamples taken haphazard from their context, but he will at the\r\nsame time see how middle-game positions, which give opportunities\r\nfor special forms of attack, are evolved from the opening.\r\n\r\nIt has been my desire to make the subject easily understandable\r\nand at the same time entertaining, and to appeal less to the\r\nmemory of my readers than to their common sense and intelligence.\r\nI hope in that way not to have strayed too far from the ideal I\r\nhad in mind when writing this book, namely, to apply to chess the\r\nonly method of teaching which has proved productive in all\r\nbranches of science and art, that is, the education of individual\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIf I have succeeded in this, I shall have the satisfaction of\r\nhaving contributed a little to the furthering, in the wide\r\ncircles in which it is played, of the game which undoubtedly\r\nmakes the strongest appeal to the intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD LASKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nI. RULES OF THE GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nA GAME of chess is played by two opponents on a square board\r\nconsisting of sixty-four White and Black squares arranged\r\nalternately. The forces on each side comprise sixteen units,\r\nnamely a King, a Queen, two Rooks, two Bishops, two Knights, and\r\neight Pawns. All units move according to different laws, and the\r\ndifference in their mobility is the criterion of their relative\r\nvalue and of the fighting power they contribute towards achieving\r\nthe ultimate aim, namely, the capture of the opposing King.\r\nBefore I can explain what is meant by the capture of the King, I\r\nmust set out the rules of the game in full.\r\n\r\nDiagram 1 shows the position the forces take up for the contest.\r\nThe board is so placed that there is a white square at the top\r\nleft-hand corner. The Rooks take up their positions at the corner\r\nsquares, and next to them the Knights.  Next to those again are\r\nthe Bishops, and in the centre the King and Queen, the White\r\nQueen on a White square, and the Black Queen on a Black square.\r\nThe eight pawns occupy the ranks immediately in front of the\r\npieces. From this initial position, White begins the game in\r\nwhich the players must move alternately.\r\n\r\nThe pieces move in the following way: The Rook can move from any\r\nsquare it happens to be on, to any other square which it can\r\nreach in a straight line, either perpendicularly or horizontally,\r\nunless there is another piece of the same colour in the way, in\r\nwhich case it can only move as far as the square immediately in\r\nfront of that piece. If it is an opposing piece which blocks the\r\nway, he can move on to the square that piece occupies, thereby\r\ncapturing it. The piece thus captured is removed from the board.\r\nThe Bishop can operate along either of the diagonals of which the\r\nsquare on which he is standing forms part. A Bishop on a White\r\nsquare can therefore never get on to a Black one.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R | #Kt| #B | #Q | #K | #B | #Kt| #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P | #P | #P | #P | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R | ^Kt| ^B | ^Q | ^K | ^B | ^Kt| ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         a    b    c    d    e    f    g    h\r\n\r\n                DIAG. 1.\r\n\r\nThe Queen commands both the straight and the oblique lines which\r\nstart from the square she stands on, and therefore unites the\r\npower of both Rook and Bishop in her movements.\r\n\r\nThe King has similar powers to the Queen, but curtailed, inasmuch\r\nas he can only move one step at a time. He therefore only\r\ncontrols one neighbouring square in any direction.\r\n\r\nThe Knight plays and captures alternately on White and Black\r\nsquares, and only reaches such squares as are nearest to him\r\nwithout being immediately adjacent; his move is as it were\r\ncomposed of two steps, one square in a straight line, and one in\r\nan oblique direction. Diagram 2 will illustrate this.[1]\r\n\r\n    I should like to quote my friend Mr. John Hart’s clever definition\r\n    of the Knight’s move, though it may not be new. If one conceives a\r\n    Knight as standing on a corner square of a rectangle three squares\r\n    by two, he is able to move into the corner diagonally opposite.\r\n\r\nThe pawns only move straight forward, one square at a time,\r\nexcept at their first move, when they have the option of moving\r\ntwo squares. In contrast to the pieces, the pawns do not capture\r\nin the way they move. They move straight forward, but they\r\ncapture diagonally to the right and left, again only one square,\r\nand only forward. Therefore a pawn can only capture such pieces\r\nor pawns as occupy squares of the same colour as the square on\r\nwhich it stands. If, in moving two squares, a pawn traverses a\r\nsquare on which it could have been captured by a hostile pawn,\r\nthat pawn has the right to capture it, as if it had moved only\r\none square. This is called capturing _en passant_. However, this\r\ncapture can only be effected on the very next move, otherwise the\r\nprivilege of capturing _en passant_ is lost.\r\n\r\n       ---------------------------------------\r\n    8 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    7 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    6 |    |    |    | *  |    | *  |    |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    5 |    |    | *  |    |    |    | *  |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    4 |    |    |    |    | ^Kt|    |    |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    3 |    |    | *  |    |    |    | *  |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    2 |    |    |    | *  |    | *  |    |    |\r\n      |---------------------------------------|\r\n    1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       ---------------------------------------\r\n        A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nIf a player succeeds in reaching the eighth rank with one of his\r\npawns he is entitled to call for any piece of higher grade, with\r\nthe exception of the King, in place of such pawn.\r\n\r\nEach move in a game of chess consists of the displacement of one\r\npiece only, with the exception of what is termed “castling,” in\r\nwhich the King and either Rook can be moved simultaneously by\r\neither player once in a game. In castling, the King moves\r\nsideways to the next square but one, and the Rook to which the\r\nKing is moved is placed on the square which the King has skipped\r\nover. Castling is only allowed if neither the King nor the Rook\r\nconcerned have moved before, and if there is no piece between the\r\nRook and King.\r\n\r\nDiagram 3 shows a position in which White has castled on the\r\nQueen’s side, and Black on the King’s side. Castling is not\r\npermitted if the King in castling must pass over a square\r\nattacked by a hostile piece. A square (or a piece) is said to be\r\n“attacked” when the square (or the piece) is in the line of\r\naction of a hostile unit. A square (or a piece) is said to be\r\ncovered or protected if an opposing piece occupying that square\r\n(or capturing the piece) could itself be captured.\r\n\r\nWhen attacking the King it is customary to call “check,”  to\r\nnotify the opponent of the fact; for the attack on the King\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    | #R |    | #R | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P |    |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #P |    | #P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    | ^P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^P |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    | ^K | ^R |    |    |    | ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nmust be met in some way or other. This can be done by capturing\r\nthe attacker or by interposing a piece (this is not possible in\r\ncase of attack by a Knight or a pawn), or lastly by moving the\r\nKing to a square which is not attacked. The latter must not be\r\ndone by castling. If it is impossible by any of the three methods\r\nabove mentioned to avoid the attack upon the King, the King is\r\nsaid to be checkmated, and the game is ended.\r\n\r\nIf a King is unable to move, though not attacked, and none of his\r\nremaining pieces can move, the King is said to be stale-mated,\r\nand the game is drawn. A game is also drawn when neither side has\r\nsufficient material left to enforce a mate.  (Compare page 63.)\r\n\r\nIf a player resigns his game before he is actually mated, he\r\nacknowledges that in the end mate is unavoidable, and the game is\r\ncounted as a loss to him.\r\n\r\nA game is null and void if it is shown that a mistake was made in\r\nsetting the board or men. The same applies when in the course of\r\nthe game the position and number of pieces have been altered in a\r\nmanner not in accordance with the proper course of play, and the\r\nlatter cannot be re-constructed from the point where the error\r\nwas made.\r\n\r\nIf a player having the move touches one of his pieces he is under\r\ncompulsion to move it; if he touches a hostile piece he must\r\ncapture it, provided that the piece can be properly moved or\r\ncaptured in either case. This rule is of no effect if the piece\r\nso touched cannot be moved or captured, as the case may be.  So\r\nlong as the hand has not left the piece to be moved, the latter\r\ncan be placed on any accessible square. If a player touches a\r\npiece with the sole object of adjusting its position, he must\r\napprise his opponent of his intention by saying  “J’adoube”\r\nbeforehand. It is best to move the King first when castling. If\r\nthe Rook is moved first, and unless the King is played almost\r\nsimultaneously, a doubt might arise whether castling or a Rook’s\r\nmove only was intended.\r\n\r\nIf a player has castled illegally, Rook and King must be moved\r\nback, and the King must make another move, if there is a legal\r\none. If not, any other move can be played. A player who makes an\r\nillegal move with a piece must retract that move, and make\r\nanother one if possible with the same piece. If the mistake is\r\nonly noticed later on, the game should be restarted from the\r\nposition in which the error occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. NOTATION\r\n\r\nA special notation has been adopted to make the study of games\r\nand positions possible, and it is necessary for students of the\r\ngame to become thoroughly conversant with it. The original and\r\nearliest notation is still in use in English, French, and Spanish\r\nspeaking countries. It is derived from the original position in\r\nthe game, in that the squares take the names of the pieces which\r\noccupy them. Thus the corner squares are called R 1 (Rook’s\r\nsquare or Rook’s first), and to distinguish them from one another\r\nQR1 or KR 1 (Queen’s or King’s Rook’s square). The squares\r\nimmediately in front are called QR2 or KR2. A distinction is made\r\nbetween White and Black, and White’s R 1 is Black’s R 8, Black’s\r\nR 2 is White’s R 7, White’s K B 3 is Black’s KB6, and so on. K\r\nstands for King; Q for Queen; B for Bishop; Kt for Knight; R for\r\nRook; and P for Pawn. In describing a capture, only the capturing\r\nand the captured pieces are mentioned, and not the squares.\r\n\r\nWhen confusion is possible, it is customary to add whether King’s\r\nside or Queen’s side pieces are concerned, e.g. KR×Q Kt.  In\r\nthis notation it is necessary to bear in mind which Kt is the Q\r\nKt, which R is the KR. This becomes increasingly difficult as the\r\ngame goes on and pieces change their places.  Many sets of\r\nchessmen have one Rook and one Knight stamped with a special\r\nsign, to show they are King’s side pieces. This is not necessary\r\nin the case of Bishops: a white KB is always on white squares, a\r\nwhite QB on black squares.\r\n\r\nA more modern notation is the algebraic notation, which has been\r\nadopted in most countries. It has the advantage of being\r\nunmistakably clear, and also more concise. Here the perpendicular\r\nlines of squares (called files) are named with the letters a-h,\r\nfrom left to right, always from the point of view of White, and\r\nthe horizontal lines of squares (called ranks) with numbers 1-8\r\nas before, only with the distinction that the rank on which the\r\nWhite pieces stand is always called the first; thus the square we\r\nnamed White’s QB2 or Black’s QB7 is now called c2 in both cases.\r\nBlack’s QB2 (White’s QB7) is always c7. In capturing, the square\r\non which the capture takes place and not the piece captured is\r\nnoted, for the sake of uniformity. In the case of pawn moves, the\r\nsquares only are noted.\r\n\r\nO--O stands for castles on the King’s side; O--O--O stands for\r\ncastles on the Queen’s side; : or × stands for captures; + for\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nIn the following opening moves, both notations are used for the\r\npurpose of comparison:\r\n\r\n    1. P-Q 4      P-Q4         1. d4         d5\r\n    2. P-QB4      P-K3         2. c4         e6\r\n    3. Kt-QB3     P-QB4        3. Ktc3       c5\r\n    4.

Ktge2      O--O\r\n\r\nIn most books in which the algebraic notation is used, both\r\nsquares of a move are written out for the benefit of the student.\r\nThe moves above would then look like this:\r\n\r\n          1. d2-d4          d7-d5\r\n          2. c2-c4          e7-e6\r\n          3.

Ktg1-e2        O--O\r\n\r\nTo conclude: I will give the denomination of the pieces in\r\nvarious languages:\r\n\r\nEnglish .............. K  Q  R  B  Kt P   Castles\r\nFrench  ..............

The\r\nperiod required for such development largely depends upon the\r\nspecial gifts the learner may possess, but in the main the\r\nquestion of methods predominates. Most beginners do not trouble\r\nvery much about any particular plan in their study of chess, but\r\nas soon as they have learnt the moves, rush into the turmoil of\r\npractical play. It is self-evident that their prospects under\r\nsuch conditions cannot be very bright. The play of a beginner is\r\nplanless, because he has too many plans, and the capacity for\r\nsubordinating all his combinations to one leading idea is non-\r\nexistent. Yet it cannot be denied upon investigation that a\r\ncertain kind of method is to be found in the play of all\r\nbeginners, and seems to come to them quite naturally. At first\r\nthe pawns are pushed forward frantically, because there is no\r\nappreciation of the power and value of the pieces. Conscious of\r\nthe inferiority of the pawns, the beginner does not conclude that\r\nit must be advantageous to employ the greater power of the\r\npieces, but is chiefly concerned with attacking the opposing\r\npieces with his pawns in the hope of capturing them. His aim is\r\nnot to develop his own forces, but to weaken those of his\r\nopponent.  His combinations are made in the hope that his\r\nadversary may not see through them, nor does he trouble much\r\nabout his opponent’s intentions. When most of his pawns are gone,\r\nthen only do his pieces get their chance. He has a great liking\r\nfor the Queen and the Knight, the former because of her\r\ntremendous mobility, the latter on account of his peculiar step,\r\nwhich seems particularly adapted to take the enemy by surprise.\r\nWhen watching beginners you will frequently observe numberless\r\nmoves by a peripatetic Queen, reckless incursions by a Knight\r\ninto the enemy’s camp, and when the other pieces join in the\r\nfray, combination follows combination in bewildering sequence and\r\nfantastic chaos. Captures of pieces are planned, mating nets are\r\nwoven, perhaps with two pieces, against a King’s position, where\r\nfive pieces are available for defence. This unsteadiness in the\r\nfirst childish stages of development makes it very difficult for\r\nthe beginner to get a general view of the board. Yet the\r\nsurprises which each move brings afford him great enjoyment.\r\n\r\nA few dozen such games are by no means wasted. After certain\r\nparticular dispositions of pieces have proved his undoing, the\r\nbeginner will develop the perception of threats.  He sees dangers\r\none or two moves ahead, and thereby reaches the second stage in\r\nhis development.\r\n\r\nHis combinations will become more and more sound, he will learn\r\nto value his forces more correctly, and therefore to husband his\r\npieces and even his pawns with greater care. In this second stage\r\nhis strength will increase steadily, but, and this is the\r\ndrawback, only as far as his power of combination is concerned.\r\nUnless a player be exceptionally gifted, he will only learn after\r\nyears of practice, if at all, what may be termed  “positional\r\nplay.” For that, it is necessary to know how to open a game so as\r\nto lay the foundation for a favourable middle game, and how to\r\ntreat a middle game, without losing sight of the possibilities of\r\nthe end-game. It is hopeless to try to memorise the various\r\nopenings which analysis have proved correct, for this empirical\r\nmethod fails as soon as the opponent swerves from the recognised\r\nlines of play. One must learn to recognise the characteristics of\r\nsound play. They apply to all and any position, and the\r\nunderlying principles must be propounded in a manner generally\r\napplicable. And this brings me to the substance of my subject,\r\nround which I will endeavour to build up a system compatible with\r\ncommon sense and logic.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to develop my theme, I shall set down a number\r\nof elementary rules which will facilitate the understanding of\r\nsuch simple combinations as occur at every step in chess.\r\n\r\nIf we ignore the comparatively small proportion of games in which\r\nthe mating of the opponent’s King is accomplished on a full\r\nboard, we can describe a normal, average game of chess in the\r\nfollowing way. Both sides will employ their available forces more\r\nor less advantageously to execute attacking and defensive\r\nmanœuvres which should gradually lead to exchanges. If one side\r\nor the other emerges from the conflict with some material gain,\r\nit will generally be possible to force a mate in the end-game,\r\nwhilst if both sides have succeeded by careful play to preserve\r\nequality of material, a draw will generally ensue.\r\n\r\nIt will be found a little later that a single pawn may suffice,\r\nwith some few exceptions, to achieve a victory, and we shall\r\nadopt the following leading principle for all combinations, viz.\r\nloss of material must be avoided, even if only a pawn.  It is a\r\ngood habit to look upon every pawn as a prospective Queen. This\r\nhas a sobering influence on premature and impetuous plans of\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, victory is often brought about by a timely\r\nsacrifice of material.\r\n\r\nBut in such cases the sacrificing of material has its\r\ncompensation in some particular advantage of position. As\r\nprinciples of position are difficult for beginners to grasp, I\r\npropose to defer their consideration for the present and to\r\ndevote my attention first to such combinations as involve\r\nquestions of material. Let us master a simple device that makes\r\nmost combinations easy both for attack and defence. It amounts\r\nmerely to a matter of elementary arithmetic, and if the beginner\r\nneglects it, he will soon be at a material disadvantage.\r\n\r\nDiagram 4 may serve as an example:\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    | #R |    |    | #K |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P | #Q | #Kt| #R |    | #P |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #Kt| #B | #P |    |    | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |    | ^P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    | ^P |    | ^Kt|    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^B |    | ^Q | ^R |    | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    |    | ^R |    | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nIt is Black’s move, and we will suppose he wishes to play P-K4. A\r\nbeginner will probably calculate thus: I push on my pawn, he\r\ntakes with his pawn, my Knight takes, so does his, then my Bishop\r\ntakes, and so on. This is quite wrong, and means waste of time\r\nand energy.\r\n\r\nWhen the beginner considers a third or fourth move in such a\r\ncombination, he will already have forgotten which pieces he\r\nintended to play in the first moves. The calculation is perfectly\r\nsimple upon the following lines: I play P-K4, then my pawn is\r\nattacked by a pawn and two Knights, a Bishop and two Rooks, six\r\ntimes in all. It is supported by a Bishop, two Knights, two Rooks\r\nand a Queen, six times in all. Therefore I can play P-K4,\r\nprovided the six units captured at K4 are not of greater value\r\nthan the six white units which are recaptured. In the present\r\ninstance both sides lose a pawn, two Knights, two Rooks, and a\r\nBishop, and there is no material loss. This established, he can\r\nembark on the advance of the KP without any fear.\r\n\r\nTherefore: in any combination which includes a number of\r\nexchanges on one square, all you have to do is to count the\r\nnumber of attacking and defending units, and to compare their\r\nrelative values; the latter must never be forgotten. If Black\r\nwere to play KtxP in the following position, because the pawn at\r\nK 5 is attacked three times, and only supported twice, it would\r\nbe an obvious miscalculation, for the value of the defending\r\npieces is smaller.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] It is difficult to compare the relative value of the different\r\n    pieces, as so much depends on the peculiarities of each position,\r\n    but, generally speaking, minor pieces, Bishop and Knight, are\r\n    reckoned as equal; the Rook as equal to a minor piece and one or\r\n    two pawns (to have a Rook against a minor piece, is to be the\r\n    “exchange”  ahead). The Queen is equal to two Rooks or three minor\r\n    pieces.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    | #R |    | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    | #P |    | #R |    | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    | #P |    |#Kt |    | #P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    | ^P |    |    |    |^Kt |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^B |    |    |    | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    | ^R |    | ^K |    |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

B-B2) Black can also\r\nmobilise three more units for the defence in the same number of\r\nmoves (1. Kt-B4 or K3, 2. B-Kt2, 3. R-Q1). There is,\r\nconsequently, no immediate danger, nor is there anything to fear\r\nfor some time to come, as White has no other piece which could\r\nattack the pawn for the fifth time.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    | #R | #B | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P |    | #R |    |    |#Kt | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    |    |    |    | #P |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    | #P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    | ^P |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 | ^P |^Kt |    |    |    | ^P | ^B |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 |    |    | ^R |    |    |    | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    | ^R |    |    |    | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

Where an\r\nopponent is missing, the gap must be filled by reference to such\r\nbooks as treat of the science of combination and give examples\r\ntaken from actual play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CHESS STRATEGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn bringing the teachings of this book under the collective\r\nheading “Chess Strategy,” it was not in any way my intention to\r\ndraw anything like an exact parallel between the manœuvres on\r\nthe chess-board and military operations in actual warfare. In\r\ntrying to seek such analogies there is great danger of being led\r\nastray, and little likelihood of gaining knowledge that might be\r\nof use in practical play. Plain common-sense will give us all we\r\nneed, without our being influenced by those tactical and\r\nstrategical considerations that have been found useful in war.\r\n\r\nThe following definition may not be out of place: Strategy sets\r\ndown the whole of the problems which must be solved in war, in\r\norder to attain the ultimate result aimed at; tactics solve such\r\nproblems in various ways, and according to the conditions\r\nprevailing in the particular case. Sound strategy, when setting\r\nthe task, must never lose sight of tactical practicability, and\r\nonly a thorough knowledge of tactical resources makes correct\r\nstrategy possible.\r\n\r\nNow we shall not under any circumstances, as unfortunately even\r\ngreat chess masters have done, seek in outward similarities\r\njustification for transferring to chess the teachings of the\r\nstrategy and tactics of war. It sounds pretty enough to say:\r\nChess is a game of war--the various pieces represent the various\r\nkinds of forces: the pawns represent the infantry, the Knights\r\ntake the place of cavalry, the Rooks do the work of heavy\r\nartillery, sweeping broad lines; the different ways in which the\r\npieces move find a parallel in the topography of the theatre of\r\nwar, in that the various battle-fields are more or less easy of\r\naccess. But it is quite unjustifiable to assign to the Knights\r\nthe functions of scouts, and to say that Rooks should stay in the\r\nbackground, as heavy artillery, and so on. Such pronouncements\r\nwould not have the slightest practical value.  What we take from\r\nthe science of warfare is merely the definition. In each game the\r\nstrategy of chess should set us the tasks which must be\r\naccomplished (in order to mate the opponent’s King), and tactics\r\npoint the way in which it is possible to solve such problems.\r\nCorrect chess strategy will only set such tasks as are tactically\r\npossible, and, if we wish to expound the principles of chess\r\nstrategy, we cannot exclude chess tactics from the field of our\r\nobservations. If here and there the results of our deliberations\r\nbear some analogy to actual warfare, we may certainly give way to\r\na kind of aesthetic satisfaction in that our own occupation has\r\nsome parallel in real life, but we must never fashion our\r\nprinciples in accordance with such fortuitous circumstances.\r\n\r\nHaving surveyed the problems we have to solve, we can now plunge\r\ninto our subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter, when considering special cases in\r\nelementary combinations, we have already noticed the important\r\npart played in each skirmish by the balance between the attacking\r\nand defending units. Speaking quite generally, common-sense will\r\ntell us that, in all operations on the chess-board, the main\r\nconsideration for the defence will be to maintain that balance,\r\nand that there is only justification for an attack when it is\r\npossible to concentrate more forces on the strategic point than\r\ncan be mustered by the defence. However, one very important point\r\nmust not be neglected, though I did not touch upon it when\r\ndiscussing elementary combinations for fear of complicating\r\nmatters for beginners: the balance between the contending forces\r\nis by no means established by their numerical equality. A\r\nparamount factor is the mobility of such forces, and as soon as\r\nit is no longer one of the elementary cases of capture and\r\nrecapture described previously, this factor must be taken into\r\naccount in order to decide, on a general survey, whether there is\r\na sufficient defence to an impending attack, or whether one’s own\r\nintended attack is likely to prevail. That mobility is the first\r\nand foremost consideration should be self-evident, since the\r\nrelative value of the pieces can only make itself felt by their\r\ngreater or lesser mobility.\r\n\r\nExcept in certain positions, which are brought about by some\r\nparticular array of the pieces, the intrinsic value of a Rook is\r\ngreater than that of a Bishop, because it can command all the\r\nsquares on the board, whilst a Bishop is tied to its own colour;\r\nKnight and Bishop are considered equivalent, because the Knight’s\r\nadvantage in being able to act on all the squares of either\r\ncolour is balanced by the fact that the Bishop can sweep long\r\ndiagonals. Two Bishops are, generally speaking, of greater value\r\nthan two Knights, because together they also act on all the\r\nsquares, and their command of long diagonals is a clear\r\nadvantage. The whole of this valuation, however, comes to nought\r\nwhen the pieces are hindered in their mobility by the peculiarity\r\nof any particular position.\r\n\r\nWe will consider one instance from end-game play, and one from\r\nthe openings.\r\n\r\nIn Diagram 13, White derives no advantage from being\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    |    |    |    |    | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    | #P |    |    |    | #P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 | #P |    | #P |    | #P | ^P | #P |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 | ^P |    | ^P | #Kt| ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    | ^P |    | ^R |    |    | ^P | ^K |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nWhite will assail the Black King’s position on the Queen side,\r\nand Black is unable to concentrate his forces quickly enough for\r\nthe defence of the jeopardised entrenchments. Let us therefore\r\nbear in mind that the mobility of the pieces is the deciding\r\nfactor of their efficiency, and that mobility is the highest\r\ncriterion by which to judge the merits (or demerits)  of their\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider this principle in its application to the\r\nthree stages of play, namely, the opening, the middle-game, and\r\nthe ending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE OPENING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only pieces available on the first move are the Knights.  In\r\norder to develop other pieces as well, it is necessary to move\r\npawns first, and such pawn moves will be best as give an outlet\r\nto as many pieces as possible. For quick development is of the\r\nutmost importance, and he who succeeds first in placing all his\r\npieces, from their initial awkward positions, to such places as\r\ngive them command of the greatest possible number of squares, has\r\nthe better chance of concentrating a superior force on some\r\nimportant point.\r\n\r\nIt follows that White, having the first move, is, so to speak,\r\nalways morally justified in attacking, whilst Black should assume\r\nthe defensive. It is a step in the right direction, to appreciate\r\nthe truth of this proposition. Unfortunately most beginners fail\r\nto realise it, and so pave the way, from the first, to the loss\r\nof the game.\r\n\r\nThere are not many developing pawn moves to choose from.\r\nApparently from the point of view of quick development only P-K4\r\nand P-Q4 need be considered, since they free both Bishop and\r\nQueen, whilst other pawn moves liberate one piece only. Generally\r\nspeaking it is only required to move two or three pawns to allow\r\nall pieces to be developed, and it is good, on principle, to make\r\nonly such pawn moves in the opening, which are necessary for the\r\ndevelopment of pieces.  To play other pawns really means the loss\r\nof a move. To “lose a move” means to make a move which is not\r\nessential to the attainment of a desired position. Thus the “loss\r\nof a move” results also from playing a piece to a given square in\r\nmore moves than necessary.\r\n\r\nI shall now give a few games showing the far-reaching\r\nconsequences of losing moves. The first one is a typical though\r\nglaring example, which is very instructive and came to my notice\r\nsome time ago:\r\n\r\n          1. P-K4           P-K4\r\n          2. P-Q4           PxP\r\n          3. QxP            Kt-QB3\r\n          4. Q-K3           Kt-B3\r\n          5. P-KR3?\r\n\r\nI will not discuss the system of development adopted by White in\r\nhis first four moves. The last move, however, can at once be\r\nrecognised as faulty. It is the loss of a move such as occurs in\r\nthe vast majority of games played by beginners.  It was\r\nunnecessary to prevent KKt-Kt5, since the Knight could not hold\r\nthat square permanently. In any case B-K2 would have had the same\r\neffect, and developed a piece at the same time.\r\n\r\n          5. ...                B-K2\r\n          6. P-QR3??\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is very bad. The consequences of this loss of a\r\nsecond move are swift and deadly.\r\n\r\n          6. ...               Castles\r\n          7. B-B4\r\n\r\nAt last a developing move.\r\n\r\n          7. ...               R-K1\r\n          8. Q-QKt3\r\n\r\nAnother Queen’s move. The attack on the Bishop’s Pawn may be very\r\ntempting, but must necessarily be incorrect--and why? Because\r\nWhite is much behind with his development.  It is useless to\r\nanalyse any kind of attack in face of this fact.  The beginner\r\nfinds it hard to get used to this way of thinking.

P-Q4\r\n\r\nNow the King’s Pawn is attacked twice. It would be bad to support\r\nit with Kt-QB3, as White would exchange pawns and then Queens.\r\nBlack would thus forfeit his chance of castling and lose much\r\ntime in bringing the King into safety and the Rooks into play. P-\r\nKB3, of course, is impossible, as it is not a developing move,\r\nand moreover blocks the natural development of the King’s Knight.\r\nProtecting the pawn with the Queen would also block other pieces,\r\nand QKt-Q2 cannot be good, as it blocks the Queen’s Bishop.\r\n\r\nSince it seems impossible to protect the King’s Pawn, the only\r\nalternative would be to exchange it; indeed it is on the whole\r\nthe best course, although it allows a White piece to take up a\r\ndominating position in the centre. Wishing to avoid this, Black\r\nplays\r\n\r\n          3. ...       B-Kt5\r\n\r\nand, by pinning the opponent’s Knight, indirectly protects the\r\nKing’s Pawn. This manœuvre is, however, ill-advised, as Black is\r\nforced to exchange the Bishop for the Knight. The Bishop will\r\nhave moved twice, the Knight only once, therefore White will have\r\ngained a move for his development.\r\n\r\n               4.

B-QB4\r\n\r\nWhite has now two pieces more in play than Black, instead of only\r\none, and the mobility of the White Queen, which Black himself has\r\nbrought out, begins to have a threatening effect on Black’s game.\r\n\r\n              6. ...            Kt-KB3\r\n              7. Q-QKt3         Q-K2\r\n\r\nBlack cannot cover his King’s Bishop’s Pawn with Q-Q2 because 8.\r\nQxP wins the Rook, whilst now Black could play 8. ... Q-Kt5ch in\r\nreply, forcing the exchange of Queens.  The text move, which is\r\nforced, blocks the Bishop, and at the same time prevents the\r\ndevelopment of the King’s Rook, all of which is the direct\r\nconsequence of the loss of one move.\r\n\r\n              8. Kt-B3\r\n\r\nWhite rightly disdains the gain of the Knight’s Pawn, but\r\nprevents the exchange of Queens in developing a piece. He proves\r\nthe superiority of his position much more convincingly in that\r\nway. Black must now lose yet another move to protect his Knight’s\r\nPawn.\r\n\r\n              8. ...            P-B3\r\n              9. B-KKt5         P-Kt4\r\n\r\nBlack must try to develop his Queen’s Knight at last. He cannot\r\nplay QKt-Q2 at once, since his Knight’s Pawn would again be\r\nunprotected; therefore he plays the move in the text, probably\r\nthinking that now White also must lose a move to withdraw his\r\nBishop. But in view of the fact that Black’s game is wholly\r\nundeveloped, and that he plays practically several pieces down,\r\nWhite sacrifices his Knight for two pawns: he foresees the\r\nposition which occurs a few moves later, when Black is hemmed in\r\non all sides.\r\n\r\n          10.

R-Q8 mate\r\n\r\nThe final position shows in a striking manner how a few well-\r\ndeveloped pieces can be worth more than many undeveloped ones,\r\nand the whole game is an example of the fatal consequences which\r\ncan follow the loss of a move, since it often leads to the\r\ncompulsory loss of further moves in the course of the game.\r\n\r\n    “This is the curse of every evil deed\r\n    That propagating still it brings forth evil.”\r\n\r\nThe logical sequence of the moves in this game, as pointed out in\r\nthe commentaries to it, is borne out by the curious coincidence\r\nthat I once had the opportunity of playing a game in exactly the\r\nsame sequence of moves, against a player to whom Morphy’s\r\n“brilliancy” was unknown.\r\n\r\n              --------------------------\r\n\r\nThe leading principle of all opening moves is made clear by the\r\nforegoing pages, namely, rapid development of pieces, and\r\nconsequently the avoidance of the loss of a move in any shape or\r\nform.\r\n\r\nBefore treating of the various systems of openings, I will say a\r\nfew words on the principles of PAWN PLAY.\r\n\r\nEach opening is characterised by a well-defined pawn formation,\r\nand concurrently a certain method in the development of the\r\npieces. Naturally the formation of a pawn skeleton is not an\r\nindependent factor, but must be evolved with a view to\r\nfacilitating the favourable development of pieces. But when\r\nconsidering the form of a pawn position and that of the pieces,\r\nwe cannot shut our eyes to the fact that pawn formation must\r\nnecessarily be the dominant consideration in our mind. Pawn\r\nformation is of a more permanent character than that of the\r\npieces, in consequence of the latter’s greater mobility. When we\r\nhave made a rash move with a piece, to which our attacking\r\ndisposition may have tempted us, we may still have a chance of\r\nretrieving the position by timely retreat. Once a pawn has moved\r\nit cannot turn back, and only after the greatest deliberation\r\nshould we embark on changes in our pawn formation in order not to\r\ndisturb the balance of this “static element” of the game. But we\r\nshall see that the pawn skeleton which was formed in the opening\r\noften weathers the storm and stress of the middle game, and\r\nfrequently preserves its character right up to the end-game.  I\r\nwill therefore make pawn formation my starting-point in an\r\nattempt to show the way through the maze of the openings on the\r\nbasis of general strategical principles.\r\n\r\nIf our pawn skeleton is to promote the freedom of all the pieces,\r\nwe must not build it up with the narrow view of developing minor\r\npieces only, but must consider from the very first in which way\r\nit will enable the Rooks to get into action. We can unite these\r\ntendencies in making the CENTRE OF THE BOARD the main field of\r\naction for all our forces. This means for both sides K4 and Q4,\r\nand also in a lesser degree QB4 and KB4.  We shall get a clear\r\ninsight into the positional advantage of having command of the\r\ncentre later on, when discussing the middle game. At present I\r\nwill only touch the subject in a general way, explaining it in an\r\nelementary form, which will be sufficient to develop an\r\nunderstanding for pawn strategy in the opening. In the course of\r\nfurther deductions, after the grasp of this difficult stage of\r\nthe game has become stronger, I will go into details which will\r\nallow the subject to be stated in a more precise form.\r\n\r\nPlacing the pieces in the centre is of value, because there they\r\nhave more mobility than near the edge, which, of course, limits\r\ntheir range of action, and also because from the centre a\r\nconcentration of forces on a given point can generally be\r\neffected in the quickest way.\r\n\r\nIn most cases two centre squares become inaccessible at once,\r\nthrough the opponent placing one of his pawns in the centre;\r\ntherefore it would seem a good plan to lure that pawn away, and\r\nthis is rendered feasible by playing P-K4 or P-QB4 when the\r\nopponent has a pawn on his Q4, and P-Q4 or P-KB4 when he has a\r\npawn on K4. In the following we will consider such manœuvres as\r\ncould apply either to White or Black, from the point of view of\r\nWhite, to whom the initiative is, as pointed out above, a sort of\r\nbirth-right. Naturally, should White lose a move, as, for\r\ninstance, 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. Kt-KB3, Kt-QB3; 3. P-QR3? the\r\nposition is reversed, and Black is bound to obtain the initiative\r\nwhich is White’s birthright.\r\n\r\nThe pawn moves mentioned above also have the tendency of giving\r\nthe Rooks an opportunity for action. A Rook standing behind an\r\nadvanced pawn may support its further advance, or, if the pawn\r\nshould be exchanged, might get an open file.\r\n\r\nThe damage we wish to inflict on our opponent we must, of course,\r\ntry to avoid ourselves. Thus we will not easily give up a centre\r\npawn unless we can obtain some other advantage in doing so. This\r\nadvantage may be, that in exchanging the centre pawn we open up\r\nlines of attack for our pieces, or that we are able to place one\r\nof our pieces in a commanding position in the centre of the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThe following example may serve as an illustration. Supposing\r\nWhite plays after\r\n\r\n          1. P-Q4          P-Q4\r\n          2. P-QB4\r\n\r\nHis aim is to tempt Black’s centre pawn away and to make his QB4\r\nand K4 accessible for his own forces. Black might be justified in\r\ntaking the pawn, if he really could hold the pawn thus gained. We\r\nshall show later on that this is not so, and that White can win\r\nit back easily and advantageously.   Therefore Black is more\r\nlikely to play 2. P-K3.  Not 2. ... Kt-KB3; for after 3. PxP,\r\nKtxP; 4. P-K4 would open White’s game and drive the Knight away\r\nat once, gaining a move. Supposing, however, Black plays 2. ...\r\nB-B4; should White now think mechanically, “I will take his\r\ncentre pawn and consequently have the better game,” his deduction\r\nwould be wrong. For after exchanging his Bishop for the Knight,\r\nwhich otherwise would drive his Queen away, Black brings the\r\nlatter into a dominating square in the centre.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R | #Kt|    | #Q | #K | #B | #Kt| #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P | #P |    | #P | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    | #P |    | #B |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^P | ^P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R | ^Kt| ^B | ^Q | ^K | ^B | ^Kt| ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n\r\n",

RxB          QxP\r\n\r\nBlack’s Queen cannot easily be driven away from her commanding\r\nposition, particularly as White must lose a move to save his QRP.\r\nMeanwhile Black gains time for concentrating his forces for an\r\nattack which wins the Queen’s Pawn.\r\n\r\n          5.

P-K3             Castles QR\r\n\r\nand P-K4 is again a threat hard for white to meet.\r\n\r\nThis position shows, that to bring one’s opponent’s centre pawn\r\naway and to keep one’s own, does not under all circumstances mean\r\nthe command of the centre, but that the opening up of files and\r\ndiagonals for one’s pieces towards the centre is an important\r\nmoment in the fight for positional advantage.\r\n\r\nConsiderations of this kind will help to improve our judgment in\r\nmany of the various openings treated in the following pages.\r\n\r\nWe will class the openings in this way:\r\n\r\n    A. White 1. P-K4.\r\n\r\n            (a) Black 1. P-K4\r\n            (b) Black 1. Any other move\r\n\r\n    B. White 1. P-Q4.\r\n\r\n            (a) Black 1. P-Q4\r\n            (b) Black 1. Any other move\r\n\r\n    C. White 1. Any other move\r\n\r\nWe shall find that openings classed under C generally lead to\r\npositions treated under A and B.\r\n\r\nA. We have already come to the conclusion that after 1. P-K4, P-\r\nK4 White does well to try to force the exchange of Black’s centre\r\npawn on Q4 or KB4, and that Black will try to counteract this,\r\nunless by allowing the exchange he gets a chance of exerting\r\npressure in the centre by means of his pieces.\r\n\r\nWe will first see what happens when White undertakes the advance\r\nin question on his second move. Superficially the difference\r\nbetween 2. PQ4 and 2. P-KB4 is that in the first case the pawn\r\nthus advanced is covered, while in the second it is not. An\r\nopening in which a pawn sacrifice is offered, is called a\r\n“gambit”; 2. P-KB4 is therefore a gambit.\r\n\r\n2. P-Q4 is only a gambit if after 2. ... PxP White does not\r\nrecapture the pawn. Nevertheless this opening has been called the\r\n“centre gambit,” and though the denomination is not correct we\r\nwill adhere to it, as it is in general use.\r\n\r\nA very considerable difference between the centre gambit and the\r\nKing’s gambit lies in the fact that in the former acceptance is\r\ncompulsory, whilst in the second it may be declined.\r\n\r\nFor: 2. P-Q4 threatens to take the King’s Pawn. To defend it by\r\nmeans of 2. ... P-Q3 is unwise, since White exchanges pawns and\r\nthen Queens, by which Black loses his chance of castling and\r\nimpedes the development of his Rooks.  2. ... Kt-QB3 is also bad,\r\nsince after 3. PxP, KtxP; 4 P-KB4, White drives the Knight away,\r\ngaining a strong hold on the centre, and Black has no\r\ncompensation for giving up his centre pawn. It may be mentioned\r\nhere that after 2. ... Kt-QB3, 3. P-Q5 would be a useless move,\r\nas to begin with it would be inconsequent, since P-Q4 was played\r\nin order to clear the centre, and moreover it would block up a\r\ndiagonal which could be most useful to the King’s Bishop.\r\n\r\nWe conclude now that Black cannot hold his pawn at K4.  He must\r\nrelinquish the centre by 2. ... PxP. He will now either attempt\r\nto bring away White’s King’s Pawn by advancing his own QP to Q4,\r\nor try to utilise the King’s file, which was opened by his second\r\nmove, and operate against White’s KP. The Rooks are indicated for\r\nthis task. We shall refer to the execution of these plans later\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn the King’s gambit, White’s attempt to bring away Black’s\r\nKing’s Pawn may be safely ignored.\r\n\r\nThe move 2. P-KB4 does not threaten to take the King’s Pawn, as\r\nBlack would win White’s KP by Q-R5ch. Black can therefore develop\r\nin security with 2. ... B-B4, and if then White prevents the Q\r\ncheck by Kt-KB3, there is no objection to Black protecting his\r\nKing’s Pawn with P-Q3, as the King’s Bishop is already developed.\r\nAfter 4. B-B4, Black has still no need to protect his KP with Kt-\r\nQB3, but can play Kt-KB3 first, because after 5. PxP, PxP; 6.\r\nKtxP would be answered by 6. ... Q-Q5 winning a piece. Black\r\nkeeps the upper hand in these early encounters because he has\r\nmade a developing move with a piece, whilst White has played a\r\npawn move which is useless for the purpose of development.\r\n\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    |    | #Q | #K |    |    | #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P | #P |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #Kt| #P |    | #Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    | #B |    | #P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^B |    | ^P | ^P | #B |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    | ^Kt| ^P |    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^P |    |    |    | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R |    | ^B | ^Q | ^K |    |    | ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This he can do by\r\nplaying P-Q4, e.g.:\r\n\r\n     2. P-KB4      B-B4     or    4. P-B3    Kt-KB3\r\n     3. Kt-KB3     P-Q3           5. P-Q4 PxQP\r\n     4. P-Q4       PxQP           6. PxP    B-Kt3\r\n     5. KtxP\r\n\r\nHere Black can get an early advantage by attacking White’s KP,\r\ntaking possession of the K file after castling on the K side.\r\n\r\nAll things considered, the student should in my opinion decline\r\nthe gambit, as in doing so he can get an easy and satisfactory\r\ndevelopment. The treatment of the “King’s Gambit accepted,” which\r\naims at holding the gambit pawn, is most difficult and leads\r\nearly in the game to such complications as none but an expert can\r\nhope to master.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: As an example of the difficult play which ensues when\r\nBlack defends the pawn in the King’s Gambit, I give the latest\r\nvariation of an attack introduced by Professor I. L. Rice, and\r\ncalled the “Rice Gambit”:\r\n\r\n1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-KB4, PxP; 3. Kt-KB3, P-KKt4; 4. P-KR4, P-Kt5;\r\n5. Kt-K5, Kt-KB3; 6. B-B4, P-Q4; 7. PxP, B-Q3; 8. Castles! BxKt;\r\n9. R-K1, Q-K2; 10. P-B3, Kt-R4; 11. P-Q4, Kt-Q2; 12. PxB, KtxP;\r\n13. P-QKt3, Castles; 14. B-R3, Kt-B6ch!; 15. PxKt, QxP; 16. R-K5!\r\nB-B4!!; 17. Kt-Q2! Q-Kt6ch; 18. K-B1, Q-R7; 19. BxR, P-Kt6; 20.\r\nB-B5, P-Kt7ch; 21. K-K1, Q-R5ch; 22. K-K2, Kt-Kt6ch; 23. K-B2,\r\nKt-K5ch; 24. KxP, B-R6ch; 25. K-R1, K-R1; 26. KtxKt, R-KKt1; 27.\r\nR-Kt5, with interesting possibilities.\r\n\r\nNumberless interesting variations are possible, but their\r\ndiscussion does not lie within the scope of this work. They will\r\nbe found in books treating of the analysis of the openings.]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore unwise for the beginner to accept the gambit,\r\nunless there be a chance of compensation for the disappearance of\r\nhis centre pawn, by forcing the exchange of White’s centre pawn\r\nas well. The following line of play would fulfil this condition:\r\n\r\n1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. P-KB4, PxP; 3. Kt-KB3, Kt-KB3; 4. Kt-B3, P-Q4!\r\nBlack thereby abandons the gambit pawn.\r\n\r\nOn principle, and when he has the choice, the beginner should\r\ngive preference to simple and clear development in the opening,\r\nrather than to the gain of a pawn, when this involves difficult\r\nand intricate play. This principle must also guide us in other\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nA good example is to be found in the so-called “Danish gambit,”\r\n[Footnote: The names of the various openings, which I mention for\r\nthe sake of completeness, are generally derived from towns or\r\ncountries in which they were first extensively played and\r\nanalysed.] which will lead us back to those openings in which\r\nWhite plays P-Q4 on his second move. After 2. P-Q4, PxP, White\r\nhas the option of sacrificing two pawns to obtain a very rapid\r\ndevelopment 3. P-QB3, PxP; 4. B-QB4, PxP; 5. QBxP. It may now be\r\njust possible for Black to avoid the many threats which White can\r\nbring to bear with his beautifully placed forces, perhaps by\r\ngiving back one or both of the pawns gained. But this question\r\ncan only be of interest to us if there is no opportunity of\r\nadopting a simple line of development at the outset. As it is,\r\nthis opportunity is not wanting. All that Black needs to do is to\r\npush on his Queen’s Pawn as soon as possible, thus freeing his\r\nown Queen’s Bishop.\r\n\r\n          2. P-Q4           PxP\r\n          3.

KPxP, QxP, Black’s position is at least as easy of\r\ndevelopment as White’s. In the position set out in Diagram 19,\r\nWhite cannot play P-K5, because Black wins a pawn by PxP without\r\nhindering his own development in the least. The equalising power\r\nof Black’s P-Q4 in all KP openings where White has played P-Q4\r\ncan be noticed in many variations. I shall now give a few typical\r\nexamples, which will show the line of play that can be adopted in\r\nmany similar cases, and which can often be evolved one from the\r\nother by altering the order of the moves.\r\n\r\n\r\n            I.

Thus, for the loss of a\r\npawn, White has a paramount advantage in position.\r\n\r\nFor after 4. ... PxP, 5.

    "text": "\r\nThe best plan for Black is to decline the doubtful gift of the\r\npawn and to bring about one of the positions, as sketched above,\r\nin which, by playing P-Q4 early in the game, Black is sure of the\r\nfree development of all his forces.\r\n\r\nBlack is able to play P-Q4 early in all such openings, where\r\nWhite does not force the defensive move P-Q3 by attacking Black’s\r\nKing’s Pawn. For instance, in the King’s gambit, since the move\r\n2. P-KB4 does not threaten PxP, Black can reply at once by 2. ...\r\nP-Q4 (Falkbeer Counter Gambit). After 3. PxQP, P-K5 (to permit of\r\nKt-KB3, which at present is not feasible on account of 4. PxP);\r\n4. P-Q3, PxP; 5. QxP, White is a pawn ahead, but his Queen\r\nobstructs his KB; therefore Black has better developing chances\r\nand should be able to win the pawn back at the very least.\r\n\r\nA second example is the Vienna game, which proceeds as follows:\r\n\r\n          2.

    "text": "\r\nThere is, however, one opening in which Black has the utmost\r\ndifficulty in preventing White from getting a positional\r\nadvantage in the centre. It is called the Ruy Lopez, and is held\r\nby many to be the strongest opening for White. The initial moves\r\nare: 1. P-K4, P-K4; 2. Kt-KB3, Kt-QB3; 3. B-Kt5. With this move\r\nWhite at once attacks the Black KP, though indirectly, by\r\nthreatening to exchange the B for the Kt. To make the capture\r\neffective, however, White must first protect his own King’s Pawn,\r\nwhich would otherwise be lost after 4. BxKt, QPxB; 5. KtxP, Q-\r\nQ5!.  At first, therefore, Black need not provide against the\r\nthreatened exchange.\r\n\r\nI shall treat at some length the various defences from which\r\nBlack can choose, and in studying this most important King’s side\r\nopening, we shall have occasion to note many points of general\r\ninterest for operations in the centre.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, two entirely different systems of defence can\r\nbe distinguished: either Black will try to maintain his centre\r\npawn, or else, giving up the centre, try to gain some other\r\nadvantage as compensation.\r\n\r\nBlack can only maintain his centre pawn if he can prevent his QKt\r\nfrom being exchanged. As is readily seen, White can attack\r\nBlack’s KP a second time with P-Q4, whilst after Black’s P-Q3 any\r\nother defensive move would hinder development. These\r\nconsiderations lead to the first main line of defence in which\r\nBlack plays 3. ... P-QR3. After 4. B-R4 Black has the option of\r\nreleasing the pin by playing P-QKt4 at some opportune moment. If\r\nWhite elects to exchange his Bishop for the Kt forthwith, he can\r\nremove the Black centre pawn after 4. ... QPxB by playing 5. P-\r\nQ4, but the exchange of the B for the Kt gives Black a free\r\ndevelopment and in consequence a good game. (Compare note to move\r\n4 in Game No. 12.)\r\n\r\nDiagram 22 reproduces a typical position in this defence.  The\r\nmore usual continuation for White is 4.

The\r\nexchange on the seventh move is compulsory, because the loss of a\r\npawn after BxKt is in effect threatened, now that the White KP is\r\nsupported by the Rook.\r\n\r\nBlack’s intention of exerting pressure on the KP is now difficult\r\nof execution, because his pieces are very cramped and hinder one\r\nanother in a restricted area. The KB in particular cannot be\r\nbrought into action without great difficulty, for instance by: R-\r\nK1, B-KB1, P-KKt3, and B-Kt2.  It is therefore advisable for\r\nWhite to develop his QB at Kt2 instead of at Kt5, in order not to\r\ngive Black a chance of exchanging his troublesome Bishop. (In a\r\ngame Bernstein-Emanuel Lasker, Moscow, 1914, there happened 9.\r\nBxKt, PxB; 10. B-Kt5, P-KR3; 11. B-R4, Kt-R2; 12. BxB, QxB with a\r\ngood game for Black.)\r\n\r\nThe defence has a totally different trend, if Black gives up his\r\nown KP, but captures the White KP at once. I have already pointed\r\nout that White would not mind his KP being taken, in view of the\r\nattack on the open King’s file. Let us now consider in which way\r\nthis attack can be planned. There are two essentially different\r\nlines, according to whether Black interpolates P-QR3 or not.\r\n\r\nAfter 3. B-Kt5, Kt-B3; 4. Castles, KtxP; 5. R-K1, Black gets out\r\nof it comfortably by playing Kt-Q3, B-K2 and Castles, and White\r\ncannot permanently prevent Black’s game from being freed by the\r\nadvance of the QP. P-Q4 for White on the fifth move is therefore\r\nstronger. Black cannot very well exchange the pawns, leaving the\r\nKing’s file quite exposed, and must submit to White playing PxP,\r\nmaintaining the pawn at K5 and preventing Black’s P-Q4 for some\r\ntime to come.\r\n\r\nThe opening might continue in this way: 5. P-Q4, B-K2; 6. Q-K2,\r\nKt-Q3; 7. BxKt, KtPxB (to make room for the Kt); 8. PxP, Kt-Kt2\r\n(Diagram 25).\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    | #B | #Q | #K |    |    | #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #Kt| #P | #P | #B | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #P |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^P |    | ^Q | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R | ^Kt| ^B |    |    | ^R | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nThe whole of the manœuvres now centre round Black’s endeavours\r\nto force his P-Q4, and White’s attempt to prevent it. Black\r\nultimately gains his point, as will be seen, but at the expense\r\nof such disadvantages in the pawn position that it is\r\nquestionable whether the whole variation (called the Rio de\r\nJaneiro Defence) is playable.\r\n\r\n9. Kt-B3, Castles; 10. R-K1, Kt-B4 (the Knight is to be posted at\r\nK3 to bring the White KKt away from his Q4, whence he prevents\r\nthe advance of Black’s QP by attacking QB6); 11. Kt-Q4, Kt-K3;\r\n12. B-K3, KtxKt; 13. BxKt, P-B4; 14. B-K3, P-Q4; 15. PxP e.p.,\r\nBxP.  This is the critical position in the Rio de Janeiro\r\ndefence.  Black has succeeded in eliminating the White centre\r\npawn, and sweeps long diagonals with his Bishops, but the\r\nadvantage cannot be maintained. White exchanges the Bishop at Q6,\r\nand there remains a backward pawn, which Black will hardly be\r\nable to hold permanently. In practice it has been shown that the\r\nend-game should be won by White in spite of Bishops of opposite\r\ncolours, as Black’s pawn at his QB4 is difficult to defend.\r\n\r\n16. Kt-K4, B-Kt2; 17. KtxB (not BxP because of BxB; 18. KtxB, BxP\r\nfollowed by Q-Kt4ch), PxKt; 18. Q R-Q1 and P-QB4.\r\n\r\nThe game is much more favourable for Black if he first plays 3.\r\n... P-QR3, and retains the option of driving the White KB away by\r\nP-QKt4, after which P-Q4 can be enforced very soon. 3. B-Kt5, P-\r\nQR3; 4. B-R4, Kt-B3; 5. Castles, KtxP; 6. P-Q4, P-QKt4; 7. B-Kt3,\r\nP-Q4; 8. PxP, B-K3, 9. P-B3.\r\n\r\nNow Black’s pieces are more mobile, and that is the reason why\r\nthis system of defence is becoming more popular than any other.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it cannot be denied that Black’s pawn\r\nformation on the Q side is weak, and that his centre is less\r\nsecure. Whilst White has a pawn firmly posted in the centre,\r\nBlack has a Knight there which will soon be driven away.  White’s\r\nQ4, the basis of his centre, is entirely in his hands, whilst\r\nBlack’s Q4 is exposed to a steady pressure by the White pieces.\r\nFinally Black’s QKt is unfavourably placed, obstructing as it\r\ndoes the QBP and preventing its falling into line with its\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\nDiagram 26 shows the position after 9. P-B3. The latter move\r\nprevents the exchange of the B after Black’s Kt-R4, an exchange\r\nwhich would allow Black to round up his pawn formation with P-\r\nQB4. The experts are not yet agreed as to the best continuation\r\nfor Black in this critical position.  To be considered are the\r\nmoves B-QB4, B-K2 and Kt-B4.  B-K2 is preferred nowadays to B-\r\nQB4, as QB4 should be kept free for the KKt in case the latter is\r\ndriven from his dominating position, e.g. 10. R-K1 and 11. Q Kt-\r\nQ2.  For if in that case Black exchanges the Knights, he only\r\nfurthers White’s development without doing anything towards\r\nstrengthening his Q4.\r\n\r\nIf Black covers the Knight with P-B4, White plays PxP e.p. and\r\nKt-Kt5, rids himself of Black’s QB, and thereby weakens Black’s\r\nQP still more.\r\n\r\nKt-B4 would therefore seem to be the best choice, as the QB\r\nbecomes mobile again after White’s B-B2, nor can White\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    |    | #Q | #K | #B |    | #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    | #P |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 | #P |    |#Kt |    | #B |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    | #P |    | #P | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |#Kt |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    | ^B | ^P |    |    |^Kt |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P |    |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R |^Kt | ^B | ^Q |    | ^R | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

This manœuvre was introduced by Em. Lasker (Petrograd,\r\n1909. For further particulars see Game No. 15).\r\n\r\nB. 9. ... Kt-B4; 10. QKt-Q2, P-Q5 (Capablanca-Em.

Lasker-Tarrasch, Petrograd, 1914).\r\n\r\nCapablanca believes that the early advance of P-Q5 can be refuted\r\nby Kt-K4, e.g. 9. ... B-K2; 10. QKt-Q2, Kt-B4; 11. B-B2, P-Q5;\r\n12. Kt-K4, PxP; 13. KtxKt, BxKt; 14. B-K4, Q-Q2; 15. Q-B2 or PxP.\r\n\r\nThe openings as sketched out up to this point give a sufficiently\r\nclear idea of the possibilities of combining sound development\r\nwith an attempt to capture the centre after the opening moves 1.\r\nP-K4, P-K4. In most cases, Black’s centre pawn being open to\r\nattack by White’s P-Q4, we find an early break-up of the centre,\r\nand concurrently the opening of the Ks or Qs file for the Rooks.\r\nThat is why games opened in this fashion have been classed very\r\ngenerally as “open,”  whilst all the other openings are called\r\n“close games.” Lately the distinction has been abandoned, and\r\nvery rightly, since in the latter openings, too, the centre can\r\nbe cleared occasionally.  We attain typical close positions when\r\nBlack does not play 1. ... P-K4 in answer to 1. P-K4, but\r\nrelinquishes all claim on his K4 and takes possession of his Q4\r\ninstead, leaving White the option of interlocking the pawns in\r\nthe centre with P-K5.\r\n\r\nOn principle it does not seem advisable for Black to play P-Q4 on\r\nthe first move in reply to 1. P-K4. Although White’s centre pawn\r\ndisappears after 2. PxP, QxP, Black loses a move through 3. Kt-\r\nQB3, and his Queen has no place from which it cannot be driven\r\naway very soon, unless it be at Q1. This, however, would amount\r\nto an admission of the inferiority of the whole of Black’s plan.\r\n\r\nThere are two moves which deserve consideration as a preliminary\r\nto P-Q4, namely, 1. ...

P-K4, P-K3; 2.\r\nP-Q4, P-Q4; 3. P-K5, divides the board diagonally, and it is easy\r\nto recognise roughly the main lines of play which will govern the\r\ngame.

P-KB4         PxP\r\n          6. PxP           Q-Kt3\r\n          7. Kt-KB3        Kt-R3\r\n\r\n                      II\r\n\r\n          3. P-K5          P-QB4\r\n          4. P-QB3         Kt-QB3\r\n          5. Kt-B3         P-B3\r\n\r\nIn both cases the initiative falls to Black, in the first through\r\nthe attack on White’s Q4, the mainstay of White’s centre; in the\r\nsecond through attack on White’s K5, the White centre itself. We\r\nmust therefore consider White’s advance of P-K5 on the third move\r\nas premature. Let us now find out whether it is advantageous to\r\neffect the same subsequently. A developing move can be\r\ninterpolated, e.g. 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3. If White plays P-K5 now he\r\ngains time for his advance of P-KB4, as Black’s Knight must\r\nretreat. On the other hand he cannot now maintain his pawn at Q4,\r\nas he has blocked his QBP. We arrive at the following plan of\r\ndevelopment:\r\n\r\n          3. Kt-QB3         Kt-KB3\r\n          4. P-K5           KKt-Q2\r\n          5. P-B4           P-QB4\r\n          6. PxP            Kt-QB3\r\n\r\nIf Black were to play BxP at once, White could play Q-Kt4 with an\r\nattack on the Knight’s Pawn. That is the object of Black’s\r\nwaiting move. White must either play 7. Kt-B3, which prevents his\r\nQ-Kt4, or 7. B-Q3, after which Black would take the pawn on B4\r\nwith his Knight, getting rid of the White Bishop. 7. Q-Kt4 at\r\nonce would be answered by P-B4.\r\n\r\n          7. Kt-B3          BxP\r\n          8. B-Q3           P-B4\r\n\r\nBlack cannot castle yet, on account of the following threat,\r\nwhich I give in full because it occurs frequently in practice:\r\n8. ... Castles; 9. BxPch, KxB; 10. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt1:  11. Q-R5, R-\r\nK1; 12. QxPch; 13. Q-R5ch; 14. Q-R7ch;  15. Q-R8ch; 16.

Q-Q2           P-QR3\r\n\r\nnot P-QB4 at once, because of Kt-Kt5.\r\n\r\n          8. Kt-Q1          P-QB4\r\n          9. P-QB3\r\n\r\n                     II\r\n\r\n          7.

Castles       Kt-QB3\r\n\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nIn both cases White has an easy development, whilst Black has no\r\nconvenient square for his Queen’s Bishop.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this drawback Rubinstein has evolved the following\r\nvariation, in which provision is made from the first for the\r\nfreedom of action of the Queen’s Bishop:\r\n\r\n          3. Kt-QB3          Kt-KB3\r\n          4. B-Kt5           PxP\r\n\r\nto open the diagonal for the Bishop at QKt2, e.g.:\r\n\r\n          5. KtxP            QKt-Q2\r\n          6. Kt-KB3          B-K2\r\n\r\nfollowed by P-QKt3 and B-Kt2.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave the French defence and turn our attention to\r\nthe Caro-Kann, of which the initial position was shown in Diagram\r\n28. Here also we find two essentially different systems of\r\ndevelopment, according to whether White plays P-K5 or gives Black\r\nthe option of exchanging pawns by 3. Kt-QB3. In the first case a\r\nvery noticeable difference from the French defence is, that Black\r\ncan bring out his Queen’s Bishop. Here the process of development\r\nmay be:\r\n\r\n          3. P-K5          B-B4\r\n          4. B-Q3          BxB\r\n\r\nNot B-Kt3, because White could play P-K6! and paralyse the whole\r\nof Black’s game by preventing his playing the King’s Pawn.\r\n\r\n          5. QxB          P-K3\r\n          6. Kt-K2 or KR3\r\n\r\nThrough this the move P-KB4, which fits into this pawn formation,\r\nis kept in reserve.\r\n\r\nWhile White’s development is easy and natural, Black has\r\ndifficulty in finding good places for his King’s side pieces.\r\nThe game can proceed generally speaking on the lines of the\r\nFrench defence. Only Black can hardly attack White’s centre with\r\nP-B3, since the Pawn at K3 would be weak in the absence of the\r\nQueen’s Bishop. On the other hand, Black would be a move behind\r\nwith an attack on the Queen’s side, since to reach QB4 his pawn\r\nwould have made two moves instead of one as in the French\r\ndefence. A certain compensation lies in the fact that White’s\r\nattacking King’s Bishop has been exchanged.\r\n\r\nIn practical play it has nevertheless been shown that White’s\r\nattack is more likely to succeed, and for this reason a variation\r\nintroduced by Niemzowitsch has been tried several times; it aims\r\nat the exchange of Queens in order to weaken and retard White’s\r\nthreatened attack, and to gain time for Queen’s side operations.\r\n\r\n          6. ...               Q-Kt3\r\n          7. Castles           Q-R3 or Kt4\r\n\r\nBut after 8. Kt-B4, QxQ; 9. KtxQ, White is so much ahead with his\r\ndevelopment that Black’s chance of equalising the game would seem\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\nIf White plays Kt-KR3 on his sixth move, he foils at once Black’s\r\nattempt of forcing an exchange of Queens, as he could play 8. Q-\r\nKKt3.\r\n\r\nOn the whole we can conclude that in the Caro-Kann defence White\r\nobtains a good game by 3. P-K5.\r\n\r\nA line of play which used to be in vogue, namely, 3. Kt-QB3, PxP;\r\n4. KtxP, Kt-B3; 5. KtxKtch, KPxKt or KtPxKt, gives Black an even\r\nchance, for although he loses his centre pawn he obtains a good\r\ndevelopment, and later in the game he has opportunities of\r\nexercising pressure on White’s QP through his open Q file.\r\n\r\nExcept the French defence and the Caro-Kann, there is no game in\r\nwhich an irregular reply to White’s 1. P-K4 necessitates any\r\nspecial considerations either in development of pieces or pawn\r\nformation. In all such cases it is sufficient to maintain the\r\npawn centre and to occupy such squares with the pieces, whence\r\nthey cannot be driven away with the loss of a move. Just one\r\nexample: If Black plays 1. ... P-QB4 (Sicilian defence), White\r\nwill not play his King’s Bishop to B4, because Black can reply P-\r\nK3, and gain a move by P-Q4.\r\n\r\nB. Let us now consider the openings in which the first move is 1.\r\nP-Q4 on either side. Here the centre cannot be cleared as early\r\nas in the openings beginning with 1. P-K4, P-K4.  The advance of\r\na second centre pawn, which there led to a clearance, is not\r\nfeasible in this case. White does not command his K4, and for\r\nsome time to come he will be unable to advance the K pawn beyond\r\nK3. In consequence the K file does not seem a likely opening for\r\nthe Rooks, and another file must be found for them. The\r\nconclusions arrived at for Black in the French defence hold good\r\nfor both sides in the opening now under consideration, and\r\naccordingly the QB file is that most advantageous for the Rooks.\r\nThe advance of the QBP strikes at the opposing centre, and, that\r\nbeing of paramount importance, the Queen’s Knight must not be\r\ndeveloped at B3 before the QBP has been pushed on.  Another\r\ndevelopment might be conceivable for the Rooks; viz. on the KB\r\nfile, and also the KKt or KR file; here, as we shall see, an\r\noccasion may arise for storming the opposing King’s side by a\r\npawn attack. But in this case, too, although it seems unnecessary\r\nto play the QBP, it is advisable to develop the Knight via Q2, as\r\nthere is a constant threat of the QB file being forced open\r\nsubsequently by the opposing forces.\r\n\r\nWe will start with the games in which the QB Pawns are played in\r\nthe earliest stages of the opening, so that the pawn skeleton in\r\nDiagram 35 forms the basis of development. The sequence of moves\r\nis of moment, because the advance of the KP, whether forced or\r\nnot, determines the possibility of bringing out the Q Bishops.\r\nThe simplest process of development based on Diagram 35 is the\r\nfollowing, in which both sides block up the QB.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R | #Kt| #B | #Q | #K | #B | #Kt| #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P |    |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    |    | #P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    | #P | #P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^P | ^P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P |    |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R | ^Kt| ^B | ^Q | ^K | ^B | ^Kt| ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

Black would be justified in playing 2. ...\r\nPxP, and so furthering White’s object of getting his (Black’s)\r\nQueen’s Pawn away, if he could permanently hold the gambit pawn,\r\nor if the giving up of the square at Q4 fits into a reasoned\r\nsystem of development.

    "text": "\r\nIf now Black answers PxP, White simply plays BxP and the P at R5\r\nis lost very soon. If Black plays instead: 5. ... P-B3, White\r\nwins back his pawn with 6. P-QKt3, PxKt P; 7. PxP, PxP; 8. BxPch\r\nby QxP, and moreover is much ahead with his development.\r\n\r\nThese considerations point to the conclusion that after 2.

The attempt to develop the\r\nQueen’s Bishop before playing P-K3 is not to be recommended,\r\nbecause the Q Kt’s pawn remains unprotected and open to an\r\nimmediate attack by 3. Q-Kt3.

(Diagram 38.)\r\n\r\nNo fault can be found with this move, although it blocks the\r\nBishop, since the latter can only be developed effectively at\r\nKt2. Moreover, the Knight at Q2 supports the projected P-B4.\r\nWhite cannot win a pawn now with 5. PxP, PxP; 6. KtxP, because of\r\nKtxKt; 7. BxQ, B-Kt5ch. Therefore 5. P-K3 must be played first,\r\nand after B-K2; 6. Kt-B3, Castles; 7. R-B1, P-QKt3; 8. PxP, PxP;\r\n9. B-Q3, B-Kt2, all the pieces have found rational development.\r\n\r\n          ---------------------------------------\r\n       8 | #R |    | #B | #Q | #K | #B |    | #R |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       7 | #P | #P | #P |#Kt |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       6 |    |    |    |    | #P |#Kt |    |    |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       5 |    |    |    | #P |    |    | ^B |    |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       4 |    |    | ^P | ^P |    |    |    |    |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       3 |    |    |^Kt |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       2 | ^P | ^P |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n         |---------------------------------------|\r\n       1 | ^R |    |    | ^Q | ^K | ^B |^Kt | ^R |\r\n          ---------------------------------------\r\n           A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nWhite can now settle his Knight at K5, and initiate a violent\r\nKing’s side attack after castling, by P-KB4, Q-B3, which could be\r\ncontinued with P-KKt4, K-R1, R-KKt1, and so on. Once the position\r\nin Diagram 41 has been reached, Black’s resources against the\r\ndangerous onslaught of the White forces are scanty. Yet he can\r\nretaliate, not by making the simplest and most obvious developing\r\nmoves, as mentioned before, but in the following way:\r\n\r\nIf White plays 5. P-QKt3 before castling, Black exchanges pawns\r\nand checks with the Queen. Now White has the disagreeable choice\r\nbetween B-Q2 and P-B3. The former must be bad, being contrary to\r\nthe plan of development as intended by P-QKt3. The latter blocks\r\nthe very diagonal on which the Bishop was meant to operate.\r\nWhite can open up the diagonal by playing P-QB4 after castling,\r\nnor would it really imply the loss of a move to have played the\r\nBP twice, since Black must move his Queen again from R4, where\r\nshe has no future. But in any case there remains the disadvantage\r\nthat White was forced to play the BP, whilst before he had the\r\noption of withholding its advance until a more opportune moment.\r\n\r\nAnother possible subtlety in Black’s sequence of developing moves\r\nwould be to withhold the advance of his KP until White has played\r\nP-QKt3, and then to play the QB to Kt5. For, as I have already\r\nremarked, the objection to developing Black’s Queen’s Bishop lies\r\nin White’s threat to attack Black’s QKtP with Q-Kt3. That\r\npossibility disappears after P-QKt3.\r\n\r\nBefore bringing the discussion of the Queen’s Pawn opening to a\r\nclose, I may remark that in tournaments it has become usual for\r\nWhite not to play P-QB4 at once, but to play Kt-KB3 as a\r\npreliminary, in order to avoid the complications of the Queen’s\r\ncounter gambit: 2. P-QB4, P-K4.\r\n\r\nIf White plays 3. PxKP, Black’s reply is P-Q5, and the obvious\r\nmove 4. P-K3 fails on account of the following pretty\r\ncombination: B--Kt5ch; 5. B--Q2, PxP; 6. BxB, PxPch; 7. K-K2,\r\nPxKtch!!; 8. RxKt, B-Kt5ch, etc.\r\n\r\nInstead of 4. P-K3, White should play P-KKt3 and develop his KB\r\nat Kt2. Black could now try to regain his pawn with Kt-K2-Kt3,\r\nbut he can also sacrifice a pawn by P-KB3, with a view to rapid\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nIt now only remains for us to discover whether Black has any\r\nother answer to P-Q4 which would necessitate close analysis on\r\nWhite’s part.\r\n\r\nHere must be mentioned: 1. ... Kt-KB3, 1. ... P-QB4, and 1. ...\r\nP-KB4. The former move prepares P-Q3, followed by P-K4. In this\r\nopening there is no reason why White should play P-QB4, as there\r\nis no prospect of opening the QB file for the Rooks. Furthermore,\r\nBlack has relinquished the square Q4 and made K4 the basis of\r\noperations. It will be more advisable to prevent Black from\r\nplaying P-K4 as far as this can be achieved in conformity with a\r\nlogical development, e.g. 1. P-Q4, Kt-KB3; 2. Kt-KB3.  Not 2. Kt-\r\nQB3, because Black could then lead into the Queen’s gambit by\r\nplaying P-Q4 and P-QB4, after which White has the disadvantage of\r\nnot being able to open the QB file. 2. ... P-Q3; 3. B-B4, QKt-Q2;\r\n4. P-K3.  Now Black can only enforce P-K4 after P-B3 and QB2.\r\nMeanwhile White mobilises all his pieces, whilst Black’s QB\r\nremains blocked and the Kt must remain at Q2 to cover the KP. If,\r\non the other hand, Black exchanges pawns in order to free the\r\nKnight, there is no Black centre left.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second irregular reply to 1. P-Q4, namely, 1.\r\n... P-QB4, two ways are open to White. One is to turn the opening\r\ninto an ordinary Queen’s gambit by playing P-K3, on which Black\r\ncan play P-Q4. The second is to play 2. P-Q5. Black will then\r\ndevelop his King’s side with P-KKt3 and B-Kt2. The Bishop is well\r\nposted here, and can frequently take up an attacking position at\r\nK4 or Q5. (See Game No. 45, Rubinstein v. Spielmann.)\r\n\r\nIf White plays 2. PxP, we have after 2. ... P-K3 a Queen’s gambit\r\naccepted by White, and, as pointed out before, this line of play\r\nis not commendable.\r\n\r\nThe last of the three irregular answers mentioned above:  1. ...\r\nP-KB4 leads to two entirely different plans, according to the\r\nsecond move chosen by White.\r\n\r\nWhite can confine himself to a simple development such as:  Kt-\r\nKB3, B-Kt5, P-K3, QKt-Q2 (Kt-B3 would only be good if preceded by\r\nP-B4, because Black would again lead into a Queen’s gambit with\r\nP-Q4 and P-QB4).  The other possibility is the following: in view\r\nof the fact that 1. ... P-KB4 does absolutely nothing to aid\r\ndevelopment, White can initiate a violent attack by giving up his\r\nKing’s Pawn (P-K4) and thus accelerate his own development. The\r\nplay might be as follows: 2. ... PxP; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4. B-\r\nKKt5, P-B3 (P-Q4? 5. BxKt followed by Q-R5ch); 5. P-B3. If Black\r\ntakes the pawn he lays himself open to an attack hard to meet. It\r\nseems best to play 5. ... P-K6, which calls back the White QB and\r\nleaves White’s BP as a hindrance to the development of the KKt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIRREGULAR OPENINGS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany openings in which neither P-K4 nor P-Q4 is the first move\r\nlead to well-known positions by a simple transposition of moves.\r\nFor instance, a Queen’s gambit may well have the following\r\nopening moves: 1. P-QB4, Kt-KB3; 2. Kt-KB3, P-K3; 3. Kt-B3, P-B4;\r\n4. P-K3, P-Q4; 5. P-Q4, or a French defence these: 1. Kt-QB3, P-\r\nQ4; 2. P-Q4, Kt-KB3; 3. B-Kt5, P-K3; 4. P-K4.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, systems of opening which deviate absolutely\r\nfrom those which have been proved sound and are in general use,\r\nand it is those openings that puzzle the beginner most of all. He\r\nsays: What is the good of learning correct openings, if my\r\nopponent plays incorrectly and wins all the same? This line of\r\nthought is wrong from its inception.  The student is not supposed\r\nto “learn” openings by heart, but to UNDERSTAND how the general\r\nprinciples of Chess Strategy are applied to any opening. Such\r\nknowledge can never be obtained from a tabulated analysis, but\r\ncan only be arrived at by the application of common sense. If a\r\nplayer succeeds in winning in spite of an inferior opening, it\r\nonly proves that subsequently he has played a stronger game than\r\nhis opponent, who, after playing the opening according to the\r\nbook, did not know how to proceed further. And herein lies the\r\nweakness, and not in the absence of knowledge of the analysis of\r\nopenings. The latter is rated far too highly.  Any player will\r\nhold his own in the opening, as soon as he has grasped the real\r\nmeaning of those principles which I cannot repeat often enough,\r\nviz.: 1st, quick development of pieces and avoidance of lost\r\nmoves; 2nd, the maintenance of a pawn centre, hampering the\r\ndevelopment of the opposing forces, and the avoidance of pawn\r\nmoves that do not contribute to the development of pieces.\r\n\r\nHow to conduct the middle game and end-game is not entirely a\r\nmatter of deduction from such general rules. In order to play the\r\nend-game correctly, one must know certain things and positions\r\nwhich arise from and may be said to be peculiar to the purely\r\narbitrary rules of chess. The same applies to the middle game, as\r\nin most cases it must be played with a view to the end-game which\r\nensues, unless there be a chance of mating the opponent before.\r\nThe student should have, therefore, a knowledge of the end-game\r\nbefore he can hope to be able to conduct the middle game\r\nefficiently. For this reason I have decided to treat of the end-\r\ngame first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE END-GAME\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUST as it is difficult to state the exact point at which an\r\nopening ends, so is it equally difficult to say where the end-\r\ngame may be said to commence. One of the main characteristics of\r\nend-games is the active part taken by the King.  Clearly the King\r\ncannot venture out into the field of operations until there has\r\nbeen an exchange of the majority of the pieces, so that there can\r\nbe no danger of his being mated. As soon as a player has attained\r\nsome advantage in material which ensures the victory in the end-\r\ngame, he will try to bring about the end-game by exchanging\r\npieces, for there the lines on which to push home his advantage\r\nare clearly set out.\r\n\r\nIt is first necessary to know what surplus of forces is the\r\nminimum required in order to force a mate. The positions in which\r\nthe mate can be forced may be shown by a few typical examples.\r\nBut I shall lay stress mainly on one point. That is the ability\r\nto judge whether an end-game which could be brought about by\r\nexchanges is won or not; in other words, whether it can be\r\nreduced to one of the typical positions referred to above.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the end-game is the particular demesne of pawn\r\nstrategy. Nearly always one or more pawns survive the exchange of\r\npieces, and the knowledge of the end-game will be invaluable for\r\ngauging the consequences of pawn moves in the course of the\r\nmiddle game. The latter represents probably the most difficult\r\naspect of the strategy of chess.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable beginners to grasp the following chapters, I\r\nmust again point out a few elementary considerations.\r\n\r\nSimple end-games, that is, end-games without pawns, are\r\ncomparatively easy to understand. Let us first consider the case\r\n of a King denuded of all his troops. In order to force the mate\r\nit is necessary to obtain command of four squares, namely, those\r\nfour squares which he controls after he has been driven into a\r\ncorner. Supposing the Black King has been driven to QR1, the\r\nWhite King can prevent him from reaching two squares of different\r\ncolour, namely, QR2 and QKt2. Therefore it is necessary for White\r\nstill to have such forces as can command two more squares of\r\ndifferent colour, namely, QR1 and QKt1. As can readily be seen,\r\nit will be essential to have at least the Queen or a Rook or two\r\nBishops, or a Knight and Bishop, or two Knights. [Footnote: How\r\nthe King can be driven into a corner will be shown subsequently.]\r\n\r\nWe shall see that in the latter case it is impossible to drive\r\nthe King into a corner without bringing about a stalemate.  The\r\nmates by a Queen or Rook are so simple that I only give an\r\nexample of each for the sake of completeness.\r\n\r\n        Position 1.--White: K at QR1, Q-KR1\r\n                  Black: K at K4\r\n\r\n     1.

A mating position in the\r\ncorner which the Bishop does not command would have to be of the\r\ntype set out in Diagram 42.  Here the Bishop plays on White\r\nsquares, and the Knight in order to checkmate must move on to a\r\nWhite square; in other words, he must come from a Black one.\r\nTherefore, when the Bishop checked on the previous move and drove\r\nthe King away, the King had the option of two black squares, and\r\nhad no need to go into the corner one. He is only mated in\r\nconsequence of a wrong move.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    |    | ^K |    | #K |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    |    |    |    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 |    |    | ^B |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

We see here how the King’s\r\nposition can be counterbalanced by the weakness of a pawn, and\r\nlead to a draw. If the White QBP was not isolated but standing,\r\nfor instance, at QKt2, Black would be lost, as calculation easily\r\nshows.\r\n\r\nThe strength or weakness of a pawn position, which, as we saw,\r\nhad so deciding an influence in the end-game position just\r\ntreated, is one of the most important factors in a game of chess,\r\nand should have full consideration in the middle game. A pawn,\r\nwhen isolated, is naturally weaker than when it is or can be\r\nprotected by another. It may easily lead to the loss of a game,\r\nas the mobility of the King or a piece is reduced by having to\r\nprotect the pawn (compare End-game, p. 102).\r\n\r\nIt is frequently and erroneously thought that DOUBLED pawns as\r\nsuch are a weakness. Doubled pawns are weak when ISOLATED, for\r\nthey cannot support each other.

    "text": "\r\nA counterpart to this position is found in Diagram 69, which\r\nshows one of the few cases in which the possession of an extra\r\npawn does not force a win. It seems at first sight as if White\r\ncould win by simply assuming the opposition with 1. K-K4\r\ncontinued: ... K-K2; 2. K-Q5, K-Q2; 3. P-B5, K-K2; 4. K-B6, etc.\r\nBut Black would reply 1. ... P-B4ch! and after 2. PxPch, K-B3\r\nfollowed by KxP ensure the draw.\r\n\r\nWe come now to those end-games in which pieces as well as pawns\r\nare left on the board.\r\n\r\nAs it is my aim to give typical examples, I shall confine myself\r\nto positions where there is only one piece besides the King. Most\r\nend-games with several pieces can be reduced to that.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all end-games with pieces the King’s manœuvres used in\r\npawn endings are of no avail, as far as opposition is concerned,\r\nas the advantage of opposition means that the opponent is forced\r\nto move his King, and as long as there are pieces on the board,\r\nsuch “forced move” positions are infrequent. However, the\r\nstrength of the pawn position is of the same importance as in\r\npawn endings, just as the command of as many squares as possible\r\nis essential for the King. A third and very important factor is\r\nagain the mobility of pieces.\r\n\r\nA good example is found in Diagram 70, a position from a game\r\nPost-Leonhardt (Berlin Jubilee Tournament, 1907).\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 | #P |    |    | #K |    |    | #B | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 | ^P | #P |    | #P |    | #P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    | ^P |    | ^K |    | ^P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    | ^B | ^P |    |    | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nBlack’s pawn position is weaker, because the White pawns, being\r\non Black squares, cannot be attacked by the Bishop, whilst Black\r\nhas two isolated pawns on White squares.  Furthermore the Black\r\nBishop has less mobility than the White one, and finally the\r\nBlack King is tied to his Q3, to prevent White’s entry at B5 or\r\nK5. These drawbacks decide the issue. 1. ... B-R2; 2. P-R4, B-\r\nKt3; 3. B-B2, P-R4. (After B-R2 White would command the square at\r\nKt6 through P-R5); 4. B-Q3, B-R2; 5. B-B1, and Black resigns, for\r\nWhite threatens to establish his Bishop at B3, where the pawns at\r\nQ5 and R5 are both attacked, whilst the Black Bishop is at once\r\nforced to occupy the only square from which both pawns are\r\ncovered, namely B2. As this square must be abandoned in the next\r\nmove, Black loses a pawn and the game.\r\n\r\n5. ... B-Kt1; 6. B-K2, B-B2; 7. B-B3, and wins, or 5. ... B-Kt3;\r\n6. B-Kt2, B-B2; 7. B-B3, and wins.\r\n\r\nA corresponding instance of KNIGHT V. BISHOP is the end-game\r\nBlackburne-Schlechter (p. 102).\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to gauge the relative value of Bishop and Knight\r\nin the end-game. The Knight has the advantage of access to all\r\nsquares; against that the Bishop is able to fight at long range,\r\nand offers opportunities of gaining moves in certain positions\r\nwhere there is a “forced move” (compare p. 90).\r\n\r\nAs already stated, two Bishops are superior to two Knights\r\nbecause the limitation of the colour of squares ceases. A Rook\r\ngenerally wins against a Bishop or a Knight, sometimes even\r\nagainst a majority of one or two pawns, provided, of course, that\r\nthere are still pawns on the Rook’s side, and that their exchange\r\ncannot be forced. The following position (Diagram 71), from a\r\ngame Moll-Post, shows how to proceed in such cases.\r\n\r\nHere White can force a win in the following way:  1. RxP, P-Kt6;\r\n2. R-R6, PxP; 3. RxP, K-B2; 4. R-B2, B-Kt5; 5. R-B4, B-R4; 6. P-\r\nB4! The Black pawn position must first be torn up, if it is to be\r\nattacked successfully.\r\n\r\nNow Black’s defeat is inevitable, whether the pawn is taken or\r\nnot. The sequel would be 6. ... PxP; 7. RxP, after which the Rook\r\ngoes to KR5 and the Rook’s pawn must fall, or: 6. ... K-Kt3; 7.\r\nPxP, PxP; 8. R-B6ch, K-Kt2; 9. R-B5, and the Bishop’s pawn is\r\nlost, unless Black gives up his passed pawn. In this case Black\r\nloses also: 9. R-B5, B-Q1; 10. KxP, K-Kt3; 11. K-Q3, B-B3; 12. R-\r\nB6, K-Kt2; 13. K-K4, K-Kt3; 14. R-R6, K-B2; 15. K-B5, B-Q1; 16.\r\nR-KKt6, followed by RxP, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Queen against a minor piece wins so easily that it is not\r\nnecessary to give an example.

Although White\r\nhas one pawn more, he can only win by reducing the mobility of\r\nthe Black Rook through the following manœuvre:  1. R-B2, R-Q2;\r\n2. R-R2, R-R2. Now the Black Rook has only one move left, whilst\r\nthe White Rook has the freedom of the Rook’s file. For instance,\r\nthe Rook can be posted at R5 and prevent the Black King from\r\nattacking White’s King’s side pawns, whilst the White King makes\r\nfor the R at R7 and effects its capture. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe Black King tries to obstruct the way to the Queen’s side,\r\nWhite penetrates into the Black pawn position. Black cannot\r\nmaintain the opposition because the White Rook has spare moves,\r\nthe Black Rook none. e.g. 3. K-B3, K-Kt3; 4. R-R5, K-B3; 5. K-K4,\r\nK-K3; 6. R-R4, P-Kt3; 7. R-R5, K-Q3; 8.

If now the White King comes up, he\r\nwill in the end force the sacrifice of the Black Rook for the\r\npawn, but meanwhile the Black King captures the White pawns, and\r\nwith passed pawns on the King’s side might get winning chances.\r\n\r\nWhen there is only one pawn left in endings of R against R, the\r\nweaker side maintains the draw, if the King can command the\r\nqueening square. Diagram 79 shows a position favourable to the\r\nstronger side, and which can mostly be obtained in this end-game.\r\nBut here, too, Black forces a draw with a pretty manœuvre: 1.\r\n... R-B2; 2.

A perceptible\r\nadvantage, however, lies in the fact that White cannot bring\r\nabout a “forced move” position, as Black has the move P-QB4 in\r\nreserve. White has also an infinitesimal weakness on the King’s\r\nside, the Rook’s pawn having advanced two squares and being\r\ntherefore an easy mark. This disadvantage soon becomes apparent.\r\n\r\n          1. P-B3            K-B4\r\n          2. K-B2            P-R4\r\n          3. K-Kt2           P-Kt4\r\n          4. K-R3            K-K4\r\n\r\nWith this move advantage is taken of one of White’s weaknesses.\r\nWhite must exchange pawns. If the King moves, Black captures,\r\nfreeing B 5 for his King, from where he can later on get to K6 or\r\nKt6. But after the exchange at Kt4, Black has the chance of\r\nobtaining a “distant passed pawn” on the Rook’s file.\r\n\r\n          5. PxP             PxP\r\n          6. K-Kt2           K-B4\r\n          7. K-R2            K-B3\r\n\r\nIf Black were to play P-R5 at once, White would reply with 8. K-\r\nR3, and after PxP, 9. KxP. Black would have to give up the spare\r\nmove P-B4, to gain the square at B5 for his King. The game then\r\nwould be drawn after 10. K-Kt2!  K-B5, 11. K-B2, because White\r\nmaintains the opposition, and Black cannot get through at K6 or\r\nKt6. Black therefore manœuvres his King first in such a way that\r\nthe square at his B4 is only reached when the White King is at\r\nKt3.\r\n\r\n          8. K-Kt2           K-Kt3\r\n          9.

K-K2           K-Kt7\r\n          16. K-K3           K-B8!\r\n          17. K-K4           K-B7\r\n          18. K-B5           KxP\r\n          19.

K-B2.\r\n\r\nNow White has the opposition, and after Black wrings it from him\r\nby playing the spare move P-B4, he assumes it again with 14. K-\r\nK2, K-Kt6; 15. K-K3. But he cannot maintain it after Black’s K-R6\r\nbecause the square at Q3 for distant opposition is not\r\naccessible. After 16. K-Q2, K-R7!; 17. K-K3, K-Kt6; 18. K-K2, K-\r\nKt7; 19.

Kt-Q3          P-R4\r\n\r\nThis is now necessary, because the square B3 is weak after P-Kt3\r\nand the White Knight threatens to win the Rook’s pawn eventually\r\nwith a check at B6. For this reason Kt-Q 2, for instance, could\r\nnot be played instead of the move in the text, because 3. Kt-K5\r\nwould follow. Black now cannot exchange, of course, otherwise the\r\nposition would resolve itself to an easy end game win similar to\r\nthe one in Diagram 56. There would be nothing left but Kt-Kt1 to\r\noppose the threat of Kt-B6ch, and this would get the Knight\r\nentirely out of play, so that White could queen the passed pawn\r\neasily after 4. K-Kt6.\r\n\r\n          3. K-K5           P-B3\r\n\r\nThe King was threatening to enter via Q5 and B6.\r\n\r\n          4.

On the\r\nother hand, as soon as we have gained an advantage sufficient to\r\nsecure the victory in the end-game, we must ourselves, by the\r\nexchange of pieces, try to reduce the position to one of the\r\ntypical elementary cases which we have discussed. Now it will\r\ninvariably be found that beginners are unwilling to make these\r\nessential exchanges. This is explained by the attraction which\r\ncombinations involving the action of many pieces have for them.\r\nThey assume that exchanges, particularly of the Queens, make the\r\ngames dull. Such ideas only prove that the beginner has not\r\ngrasped the nature of chess, the essence of which is stern logic\r\nand uncompromising conclusions, and this demands the shortest and\r\nclearest way leading to a mate. To the strong player, able to\r\nplay logically, logic will always be inseparable from beauty in\r\nchess.\r\n\r\nTo play logically means to subordinate all combinations to a\r\nleading plan of campaign, but there is difficulty in finding the\r\nlatter. An unsound scheme, even if worked out to its logical\r\nconclusion, can of course be of no value. All the same it is\r\nbetter than no plan at all. And in time one gains by experience,\r\nand develops a sort of instinct for rejecting from the large\r\nnumber of possible operations all those which, properly\r\ncountered, cannot bring any advantage.\r\n\r\nBeside practical play, which is essential in order to gain this\r\ninstinct, a methodical theoretical instruction is of inestimable\r\nvalue, and accelerates the development of the student’s mind. Now\r\nthe instruction I wish to give in the THEORY of chess will not\r\ntake the form of an ANALYSIS, brought up right into the middle\r\ngame, of the various openings, tested and found correct in master\r\nplay. Such collections erroneously bear the title of “Theory of\r\nthe Openings,” and are, besides, quite useless at this stage,\r\nsince they only embody the results of ANALYSIS.\r\n\r\nIt is first necessary to ascertain a few leading principles,\r\nwhich can be taught in a most simple manner, by the exercise of\r\ncommon sense, rather than by applying oneself to the study of\r\nlong-winded analysis. The student will no longer need to discover\r\ntime-worn maxims in the light of his own weary experience, and on\r\nthe other hand, these principles will help him to understand\r\nanalysis, and to keep clearly before his mind’s eye the common\r\nand principal lines of play, of which he might easily lose sight\r\nin the labyrinth of suggested variations.\r\n\r\nI propose to show the application of such principles to master\r\nplay, and this will give us a further opportunity of deeper\r\nstudy, both of the rules set out in the first part for conducting\r\nthe opening correctly, and of the end-game principles, which\r\nshould be well considered.\r\n\r\nI have made the pawn skeleton with its attendant grouping of\r\npieces the main consideration in the study of the opening; now in\r\nthe investigation of the problems of the middle game, I will\r\nstart from the TRANSFORMATION which the pawn skeleton has to\r\nundergo in the course of further operations.  In my opinion this\r\nis the best starting-point for the choice of effective manœuvres\r\nof the different pieces.\r\n\r\nBefore we are able to evolve a practical scheme we must have\r\nunder consideration the following important points:  How do we\r\nknow if an attack is likely to succeed? In other words: On what\r\npoint should I concentrate the attack? It should be clear to all\r\nthat it is of no possible use to direct an attack on anything\r\nthat can move away. Yet beginners frequently infringe this\r\nobvious rule, and I have often witnessed manœuvres such as these\r\n(Diagram 90):\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    | #B | #Q |    | #R | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P | #P |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #Kt| #P |    | #Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    | #B |    | #P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^B |    | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    | ^Kt| ^P |    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P | ^P |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R |    | ^B | ^Q |    | ^R | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

The latter prevents the Bishop from\r\noccupying a desirable square at his QB4, and also makes the\r\nliberating move P-Q4 impossible. Therefore it would seem\r\ndesirable to drive the Queen away. But this should only be done\r\nif it is not attended by some further disadvantage.\r\n\r\nNow the average player is not particularly fastidious in his\r\nmethods. The Queen irritates him, therefore the Queen must be\r\nrepelled one way or the other. He would probably try P-QB4. The\r\nresult is that the Queen selects another good square, for\r\ninstance at K3 or QR4, but Black has not improved matters, for he\r\nstill can play neither B-B4 nor P-Q4.  On the other hand,\r\nirredeemable harm has been done, inasmuch as the Black QP now\r\nremains “backward.” The attack on the Queen by P-QB4 must\r\nconsequently be rejected.  Sallies such as these, in which short-\r\nlived attacks are made by pawns upon pieces, are always of\r\ndoubtful value. They must unquestionably be avoided if they break\r\nup the pawn skeleton, which is formed in the opening, and confine\r\nthe mobility of the pieces.\r\n\r\nAlso with regard to manœuvres of PIECES, intended solely to\r\ndrive away an opposing piece, it is obviously essential that the\r\nattacking pieces in effecting their purpose should not be made to\r\nstray too far afield, lest they become out of play.\r\n\r\nI shall delay dealing with the features underlying good forms of\r\nattack, both by pieces and pawns, until I have treated of the\r\nchoice of an objective.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have already expounded, it is clear that the subject\r\nof an attack should be incapable of evasion. Should it, in the\r\ncourse of attack, be desired to prevent a PIECE from being moved,\r\nthat can only be effected by means of a “pin.” A PAWN, however,\r\ncan be held in place either by occupying the square immediately\r\nin front of it, or by controlling the latter with more forces\r\nthan the opponent can bring to bear upon it.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 |    |    |    | #R |    |    | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 |    |    | #Q | #R | #B | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 | #P | #P |    | #P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    | #P |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^P |    | ^P | ^B |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    | ^P |    | ^R |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P |    |    | ^Q |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 |    |    |    | ^R |    |    | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nThe last two diagrams exemplify this. If in Diagram 91 Black\r\nmakes the mistake of playing P-QB4 as suggested, the backward QP\r\nbecomes a welcome objective for White’s attack. White can keep\r\nthat pawn back by playing P-Q B4 as soon as it threatens to\r\nadvance, after which he would develop quietly, double his Rooks,\r\nand bring the Q and QB to bear in a concentrated attack on Q6. A\r\nposition not unlike that in Diagram 92 will result ultimately, in\r\nwhich Black defends the pawn as many times as it is attacked, but\r\nin which White can bring up his KP to the attack, as the QP\r\ncannot move away, whilst Black has no further defensive move at\r\nhis disposal.  Play against a backward pawn nearly always\r\ndevelops on these lines, and is even easier when there is no\r\ndefending B of the same colour as the pawn. (See p. 40, and Game\r\nNo. 26.)\r\n\r\nSuch manœuvres, in the course of which pieces are pinned and\r\nattacked, are illustrated in Diagram 90. The most obvious move,\r\nwhich initiates an attack and at the same time completes the\r\ndevelopment of the minor pieces, is B-Kt5.  Attacks by means of\r\nsuch devices are so frequent and varied that it will be necessary\r\nto treat them at some length, which I now propose to do. I should\r\nalso add that, with regard to Diagram 90, the student will derive\r\nlasting benefit from a thorough study of the position, and will\r\nthus improve his power to judge of the desirability, or\r\notherwise, of obtaining open files, diagonals, doubled pawns,\r\netc. After B-KKt5, the threat is to attack the Knight a second\r\nand third time with Kt-Q5, and Q-B3, after moving the KKt away.\r\nAs Black’s KKt is only supported twice, and there is no chance of\r\nbringing up more forces for its defence, Black must undertake\r\nsomething to provide against the threatened onslaught.\r\n\r\nThe most natural plan is to develop the QB at K3, from where it\r\ncan be exchanged for the Knight should Kt-Q5 be played. The\r\ndoubled pawn, which White could force by exchanging the Bishops,\r\nis in no way detrimental to Black’s game. On the contrary, the\r\nopening of the file for the Rook, with the attendant chance of\r\nplaying P-Q4 supported by the doubled pawn, gives Black the\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe doubled pawn which Black obtains after 2. Kt-Q5, BxKt; 3. PxB\r\n(or 3. BxB), Kt-K2; 4. BxKt, would also be of no help to White.\r\nThe apparent weakness created in Black’s game at KB3 and KR3 by\r\nthe disappearance of the KtP does not assist White in this case,\r\nbecause the pieces which could take advantage of such a weakness,\r\nthe QB and the Kt at Q5, have been exchanged. There only remains\r\nthe KKt and the Q for an immediate attack, whilst the Black Rook\r\nwill soon get into effective action on the open Knight’s file,\r\ne.g. 5. Q-Q2, K-R1; 6. Q-R6, Kt-Kt3; 7. Kt-R4, KtxKt; 8. QxKt, Q-\r\nK2, followed by the doubling of the Rooks on the Kt file.\r\nConsiderations of a similar nature would tend to show that 1. B-\r\nKt5, Kt-K2; 2. BxKt, PxB is in favour of Black. The White QB,\r\nwhich is so effective in taking advantage of weaknesses at\r\nBlack’s KB3 and R3, has been exchanged. The Queen’s Knight is not\r\navailable for attack on the KBP, as it would be exchanged or else\r\ndriven off in time by P-B3. Compared with the position considered\r\nabove, which occurs after 1. ... B-K3, 2. Kt-Q5, Black has the\r\nfurther advantage of maintaining his QB, which makes it possible\r\nto push the weak KBP on to his fourth, and either exchange it or\r\npush it still further to B5, a useful and secure position.\r\n\r\nMatters would be different were Black to allow his King’s wing to\r\nbe broken up without getting rid of White’s dangerous pieces by\r\nexchanges. Let us consider what happens, if Black takes no\r\nmeasures against Kt-Q5, but only prevents White’s ultimate Q-B3\r\nby pinning the Knight with B-KKt5. White gains a decisive\r\nadvantage by bringing his Queen into play before Black is able to\r\nsecure himself against the threatened combined attack of Q and B,\r\nor alternately Q and Kt by K-R1, R-Kt1-Kt3. I will give two\r\nexamples of how the whole game now centres on the attack and\r\ndefence of the points weakened by the disappearance of the KtP,\r\nand how White pushes home his advantage in the one instance with\r\nthe help of the B, in the other by the co-operation of the Kt.\r\n\r\n\r\n     I. 1. B-KKt5, B-KKt5; 2. Kt-Q5, Kt-Q5; 3. Q-Q2, BxKt?; 4.\r\nBxKt, PxB; 5. Q-R6, and there is no reply to the threat of KtxPch\r\nand QxP mate, except through the sacrifice of the Q. Forcing the\r\nexchange of Knights is of no avail, for after 5. ... Kt-K7ch;  6.\r\nK-R1, BxPch; 7. KxB, Kt-B5ch; 8. KtxKt, PxKt; 9. K-R1, White\r\noccupies the Kt file first and wins easily: 9. ... K-R1; 10. R-\r\nKKt1, R-KKt1; 11. RxR, QxR;  12. R-KKt1 followed by mate or loss\r\nof the Queen.\r\n\r\n     II. 3. Q-Q2, P-B3; 4. KtxKtch, PxKt; 5. B-R4!  BxKt; 6. Q-\r\nR6, Kt-K7ch; 7. K-R1, BxPch; 8. KxB, Kt-B5ch; 9. K-R1, Kt-Kt3.\r\nNow Black has succeeded in interrupting the White Queen’s action\r\non the BP. But it has taken many moves, with the sole result that\r\nBlack’s Queen’s Knight is better placed. All the other pieces,\r\nhowever, occupy the positions they took up in the opening.  The\r\nBlack Knight, moreover, is only supported by the RP until Black\r\nmanages to block the White Bishop’s diagonal by P-Q4. Meanwhile\r\nWhite has gained a big start, and is ready to occupy the open\r\nfile with his Rooks. The sequel might be: 10. P-Q4!, BxP (if PxP;\r\n11. P-K5!!, QPxP; 12. R-KKt1, etc.); 11. P-B3, B-Kt3; 12. QR-Q1,\r\nK-R1; 13. R-KKt1, Q-K2; 14. R-Q3, R-KKt1; 15. R-R3, R-Kt2 (KtxB;\r\n16. QxRPch!!); 16. R-B3, followed by BxP (B6).\r\n\r\nTaking it all in all, we see from the foregoing that the pinning\r\nof the Black Knight can only be injurious to Black if he does not\r\ntake timely measures to provide against White’s Kt-Q5, which\r\nthreatens to concentrate more forces for the attack on KB6 than\r\nBlack is able to mobilise for its defence.\r\n\r\nBeginners, after having experienced frequent trouble through\r\ntheir inadequate defence of this kind of attack, try to avoid\r\ntheir recurrence by making such pinning moves impossible from the\r\nfirst and playing P-R3 on whichever side the pin is threatened.\r\nApart from the loss of time, on which I remarked at length when\r\ndiscussing the opening, such pawn moves have various other\r\ndrawbacks.\r\n\r\nWith every pawn move it should be considered whether the squares\r\nprotected by the pawn before it has moved may not need the\r\nsupport of that pawn at a later stage. This is particularly the\r\ncase with regard to squares in front of the castled King. If one\r\nof those pawns pushes on, the squares which have lost its\r\nprotection frequently offer an opening for a direct attack by the\r\nenemy’s pieces on the King.\r\n\r\nA second consideration is the fact that the advancing pawn itself\r\nbecomes a target for an assault in which the opponent, moving up\r\na pawn on the next file, brings his Rooks into play, or in which\r\nhe sacrifices a piece for the advanced pawn and the one that\r\nprotects it, thus robbing the King of the protection he sought to\r\nobtain in castling.\r\n\r\nThe following examples will contribute much to the understanding\r\nof this most important subject, the grasp of which will mean a\r\ngreat step forward for the student.\r\n\r\nThe position in Diagram 93 is from a game v. Scheve-Teichmann\r\n(Berlin, 1907). White played 1. P-R3 in order to avoid the\r\npinning of his Knight through B-Kt5. The move is not unjustified,\r\nas the Knight is required for the support of the square at Q4.\r\nThe pawn move, however, has the drawbacks enumerated above, and\r\nWhite must think of keeping a sufficiency of pieces for the fight\r\non the King’s wing, in order to prevent Black from utilising the\r\nweakness thus created for a combined assault by superior forces.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    | #B |    | #K |    | #Kt| #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #B | #P | #P |    | #Q | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 | #P |    | #Kt| #P |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 | ^P |    |    |    | #P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^B | ^P | ^P |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    | ^P |    |    | ^Kt|    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 |    | ^P |    |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R | ^Kt| ^B | ^Q |    | ^R | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nHere the advance of the White King’s side pawns has undeniably\r\nproduced weaknesses in the pawn skeleton, and these would be\r\nfatal had the Black pieces as much mobility as the White ones.\r\nBut the congestion of Black’s pieces on the Queen’s side makes\r\nhis defence unwieldy, and White has no difficulty in accumulating\r\nhis forces on the King’s side for the final assault. The\r\nprospects are that White will be able to bring home his attack,\r\nbefore Black has a chance of forcing exchanges and of bringing\r\nabout the end-game, which through the weakness of the White pawns\r\nwould probably turn to his advantage. The play (E. Cohn-Ed.\r\nLasker match, Berlin, 1909) is instructive, and shows how the\r\nattack should be conducted in such positions. 1. Kt-Kt3, B-Kt2;\r\n2. K-R2, P-B3; 3. R-KKt1, Kt-Q2; 4. Kt-R4, K-B2. The\r\nconcentration of the White pieces has become alarming, and\r\nthreatens to be continued by Q-Q2, R-Kt2.  QR-KKt1, and Kt-B5. So\r\nthe Black King decides on flight, but he finds no peace on the Q\r\nside either, because there his advanced pawns soon allow White to\r\nmake a breach in the Black position.\r\n\r\n5. Kt-Kt2, K-K2; 6. Q-K2, Kt-Kt3; 7. KR-KB1, B-B1. It is Black’s\r\nintention to play P-B4 as soon as practicable, and to make an\r\nattempt at a counter demonstration on the King’s side, 8. P-K B4,\r\nK-Q1? (Black should have kept to his original intention and\r\nplayed P-B4); 9. PxP, QPxP; 10. Q-B2, Kt-Q2; 11. P-QR4; B-Kt2;\r\n12. PxP, PxP; 13. RxR, BxR.

He has opened up avenues of attack on the Queen’s\r\nside, and is ready to utilise the weakness of Black’s QBP by\r\nplaying P-Kt4, on which Black must submit to opening the file for\r\nthe White KR or the diagonal for the White QB. In either case\r\nWhite brings vastly superior forces to bear on the Black King’s\r\nposition, and Black should lose. In this game Black escaped only\r\nthrough a mistake on the part of his opponent.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing positions it was seen how fatal weaknesses can\r\nbe, which are produced by the premature advance of the pawns in\r\nfront of the King, on whom the opposing pieces can force their\r\nattack. When the pawns concerned are on the opposite wing to\r\ntheir King, the disadvantages of a premature advance are felt in\r\na different way. The weakness concerns the pawns themselves and\r\nnot the forces behind them, and is apt to cause the loss of the\r\nend-game, particularly of Rook end-games.

I do not wish to imply that Black should have\r\navoided the exchange at his QB3 at all cost; such an exchange has\r\nalways the compensating advantage of opening a file for the\r\nRooks, which advantage often means a favourable middle game, as\r\nwill be readily understood.

The pawn\r\nitself is often useful at B 3, in that it can support the advance\r\nof P-Q 4 in the centre, should it be desired, or it can, by\r\npushing on, be brought to exercise further pressure on the\r\nopposing Kt P.\r\n\r\nThe break-up of the pawn position on the Q side can become\r\nawkward in the end-game and sometimes in the middle-game when the\r\npawns can be attacked, and pieces brought to bear on the Queen’s\r\nside without leaving the King’s side denuded of forces.\r\n\r\nThis will be illustrated by the position in Diagram 99.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    | #B |    |    | #R | #K |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P |    | #P |    |    | #P | #P | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    | #P |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    |    |    |    | ^B |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P |    | ^P |    |    | ^P | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R |    |    |    |    | ^R | ^K |    |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "\r\nFROM A GAME FR. LAZARD-ED. LASKER (PARIS, 1914)\r\n\r\nHere the pawn positions on both sides are broken, and the player\r\nthat occupies the open files first, gets a decisive advantage.\r\nIn this case it is Black’s move. We can conclude at once that\r\nWhite has played the opening badly. He must have lost two moves,\r\nfor he has still to capture the BP and then, being White, it\r\nshould be his move. This disadvantage, small as it may seem, with\r\nwhich White has emerged from the opening, is sufficient to bring\r\nhim into the greatest difficulties. Black, of course, does not\r\ndefend the pawn by B-Kt2 or B-Q2, as this would practically\r\nreduce the B to a P and, moreover, White, by R-Kt1 or Q1, would\r\nboth attack the B and obtain an open file. Instead of that, Black\r\nutilises the two moves, which he has, as it were, as a gift in an\r\notherwise equalised position, to bring both Rooks on the Kt file.\r\nThis policy allows Black to occupy the seventh or eighth rank at\r\nwill, and to attack the White pawns from the flank or rear,\r\naccording to circumstances. This menace hampers the radius of\r\naction of the White pieces, as they must always be ready for the\r\ndefence of the threatened pawns, and this gives Black by far the\r\nsuperior game.\r\n\r\nThe play was continued as follows: 1. ... R-Kt1; 2. BxP, R-Kt7;\r\n3. B-K4, B-K3; 4. P-QR3, KR-Kt1. The Knight’s file is now\r\ndefinitely in Black’s hands. White could occupy the Queen’s file,\r\nbut the Black B at K3, which prevents the entry of the Rooks at\r\nQ7, makes the operation aimless.  Therefore White is condemned to\r\ninactivity. On the contrary, Black’s line of action is clear. His\r\nentry on the seventh can only achieve something if White’s QBP\r\ncan be deprived of its support. To do this Black has only to play\r\nP-QB4-B5 and P-KB4. This, of course, weakens Black’s KB, and the\r\nWhite Rooks might obtain an entry on the K file. Therefore Black\r\nwill effect a timely exchange of one of his Rooks, after which\r\nhis King alone will hold the K file. These considerations make\r\nthe following moves clear: 5. KR-K1, P-QB4; 6. P-KR3, a further\r\nawkward necessity in positions of this kind. Before the Rook can\r\nventure out, a loophole must be provided for the King.\r\n\r\n6. ... P-B5; 7. R-K3, R-Kt8ch; 8. RxR, RxRch; 9. K-R2, P-B4; 10.\r\nB-B3, K-B2; 11. B-K2 (threatening R-QB3), R-Kt2; 12. R-QB3, K-B3\r\n(now BxP is not feasible on account of R-QB2); 13. P-B4. White\r\nwishes to keep the Black King from his Q5 but cannot do so\r\npermanently. Black, however, can occupy the Q file with his Rook,\r\nand confine the White King to his wing. 13. ... R-Q2; 14. K-Kt3)\r\nR-Q5; 15. K-B3, K-K2; 16. R-K3, K-Q3; 17. K-Kt3, R-Q7; 18. P-B3,\r\nB-B2. R-R7 would be a mistake on account of RxBch, but the QRP\r\ncannot escape. 19. P-QR4, P-Kt3; 20. B-B3, R-R7; 21. B-Q1, B-Q4;\r\n22. R-K2, R-R8; 23. R-Q2, R-R6; 24. R-QB2, RxRP. Now at last\r\nBlack has obtained material gain, which was made possible by his\r\ncommand of the open Kt file. To convert it into a win by queening\r\nthe extra pawn is only a matter of time.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen how the possession of open files reacts on the\r\nmobility of the opposing forces, forever increasing their\r\ndifficulties until the positional advantage is converted into\r\nmaterial gain. We shall meet with cases later on in which the\r\ngreater mobility of minor pieces achieves the same result and\r\nfind more and more proofs of the truth of the main general\r\nprinciples which I introduced at the outset.\r\n\r\nLet us now recapitulate the chief points touched upon in the\r\ncourse of our deliberations:\r\n\r\n     1. Generally speaking, attacks should only be directed to\r\nobjects which cannot be moved away.\r\n\r\n     2. If in particular cases the attack is aimed at driving off\r\nan opposing piece from an especially favourable post that attack\r\nis unwise, if it involves the weakening the pawn position, or if\r\npieces have to take up inferior positions in order to effect\r\ntheir purpose.\r\n\r\n     3. Pawn moves always create weaknesses, either by leaving\r\nother unsupported pawns behind, or by giving opposing pieces\r\naccess to squares formerly guarded by them, and this more\r\nspecially so in front of the castled King.\r\n\r\n     4. Attacks which depend on pawn moves are only justified if\r\noverwhelming forces can be accumulated in support, as the\r\nadvanced pawns might become the object of a counter attack.\r\n\r\n     5. As pawn moves have very generally some drawbacks, the\r\nmiddle game is the pieces’ own hunting ground.  As in the\r\nopening, the first consideration of sound play in the middle game\r\nis to make only such moves as do not reduce the mobility of the\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of such manœuvres I shall now give examples from\r\nactual master play. In my annotations of these games I have tried\r\nto keep before the student’s mind constantly the main ideas\r\nunderlying the different combinations which spring from general\r\nstrategical principles. I thus avoid burdening his memory with a\r\nmass of detail, and bring into prominence the basic principle of\r\neach line of play, thereby developing his capacity for conducting\r\na middle game, even after an unusual opening.\r\n\r\nI have fixed mainly upon such games as are illustrative of the\r\nopenings treated in the first part of this book. In most cases\r\nthe first moves will, therefore, not need any special remarks.\r\nThe end-games, being typical examples, will only need reference\r\nto the chapters in which they have been respectively dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE GAMES FROM MASTER TOURNAMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                GAME No. 1\r\n\r\n    White: Tartakower.   Black: Burn.\r\n\r\n   King’s Gambit declined (compare p. 30).\r\n\r\n          1. P-K4         P-K4\r\n          2. P-KB4        B-B4\r\n          3. Kt-KB3       P-Q3\r\n          4. PxP\r\n\r\nOn principle this exchange cannot be commended, as the opening of\r\nthe Queen’s file increases the Black Queen’s mobility.  White\r\nderives no benefit from the KB file so long as the Black Bishop\r\nmakes castling impossible. White intends to play P-B3 and P-Q4,\r\nbut the manœuvre is doubtful, and the whole opening includes an\r\ninordinately large number of pawn moves. In the present game\r\nBlack exposes the failings inherent to this system unequivocally.\r\n\r\n          4. ...          PxP\r\n          5. P-B3         Kt-QB3\r\n\r\nBlack cannot put off White’s P-Q4 by B-KKt5, for White can give a\r\ncheck with the Queen and unpin the Knight.\r\n\r\n          6. P-QKt4\r\n\r\nThe object of this move is not clear, as P-Kt5 does not win a\r\npawn (Kt-R4; 8. KtxP; 9. Q-R5ch). It does not promote development\r\neither, and only compromises the QBP and QKtP.\r\n\r\n          6. ...            B-Kt3\r\n          7. B-Kt5          Kt-B3\r\n\r\nThis is aimed at the White King’s pawn, which is deprived of its\r\nnatural support by the QKt. In this position Black does well to\r\nattack White’s KP rather than to defend his own, because an open\r\nKing’s file can only benefit him. Being able to castle, he can\r\noccupy the file with his Rook before White has time to bring his\r\nKing into safety.\r\n\r\n          8. KtxP\r\n\r\nIt would have been better to protect the pawn by Q-K2 or P-Q3.\r\n\r\n          8.    ...

The game then assumes a wild character, and as\r\nmatters are generally settled one way or another in the middle-\r\ngame, end-game considerations, both with regard to number and\r\nposition of pawns, can be disregarded. Experience has shown that\r\nthe player who develops his attack first is likely to win, and\r\nthat it is of little use to submit tamely to an assault of this\r\nkind without attempting a counter attack.\r\n\r\nSuch games are very difficult for the beginner to understand.\r\nThere is about them something violent and difficult to estimate,\r\nand years of practice are necessary in order to gain the judgment\r\nrequired for weighing up the possibilities of attack and counter\r\nattack, where the Kings have castled on opposite wings.\r\n\r\n          20. ...

P-KB4\r\n\r\nThis move is open to discussion, as the Kt which it means to\r\nsupport can be driven away by P-Q3. On the other hand, if White\r\ndoes play his QP to Q3, Black can prevent its further advance by\r\nP-Q5, after which the White KP is insecure and the KB somewhat\r\nshut in.\r\n\r\n          6.

To protect his QBP would be\r\ninferior, e.g. 8 Kt-K2, Kt-B3 or 8 B-Kt2?, PxP; 9 BxP, B-Kt5!; 10\r\nBxB, QxR5ch; 11 Q-B2, QxBch; 12 Q-Q2, Q-Q5.\r\n\r\n          8. ...

    "text": "\r\nThis is the typical position in the Max Lange attack.  With his\r\nninth move White threatened to win a piece by KtxB and Q-R5ch.\r\nBlack could not parry the threat by 9. ... Q-Q3, on account of\r\nPxP followed by Kt-K4-B6ch.  The position in the diagram appears\r\nto be favourable for Black, as all his minor pieces are in play,\r\nwhilst White’s development is somewhat restricted by Black’s\r\nstrong pawns at QB5 and Q5. For a long time this opening has not\r\nbeen played in tournaments, being considered unsatisfactory for\r\nWhite.  With the present game, and his new move of 15. B-R6,\r\nMarshall has reopened the question as to whether White’s attack\r\non the K file plus the pawn at KKt7 is sufficiently tempting.\r\n\r\n          10. Kt-QB3           Q-B4\r\n          11. QKt-K4           Castles QR\r\n\r\nThis is imperative. If Black retires the Bishop from his unsafe\r\nposition, White permanently prevents Black from castling, which\r\nis bound to be fatal in view of the open K file--e.g. 11. ... B-\r\nKt3; 12. PxP, R-KKt1; 13. P-KKt4, Q-Kt3; 14. KtxB, PxKt; l5. B-\r\nKt5, RxP; 16. Q-B3 with a violent attack.\r\n\r\n          12. KtxQB\r\n\r\nIf White tries to win the exchange in the following way:  12. P-\r\nKKt4, Q-K4!; 13. Kt-KB3, Q-Q4; 14. PxP followed by Kt-B6, Black\r\ncan initiate a promising counter attack by 14. ... BxP!!; 15.\r\nPxR-Q, RxQ; 16. Kt-B6, QxKt; 17. QxQ, BxQ. In this case White\r\nexposes his King’s side by P-KKt4 in order to benefit from the\r\nunstable position of the Black KB, but unless care is taken, he\r\ncan easily fall a victim to an attack on the open KKt file\r\n\r\n          12. ...               PxKt\r\n          13. P-KKt4            Q-K4\r\n\r\nNot Q-Q4, on account of PxP and Kt-B6.\r\n\r\n          14. PxP               KR-Kt1\r\n          15. B-R6\r\n\r\nThis is Marshall’s innovation. It gets the Bishop out of play, as\r\nP-Kt5 must necessarily follow, yet the pawn at Kt7 holds the\r\nBlack Rook, and there is a permanent threat of Kt-B6 either\r\nwinning the exchange or, if the Knight is taken, giving White a\r\npair of formidable passed pawns.\r\n\r\n          15. ...             P-Q6\r\n          16. P-B3            B-Q3\r\n\r\nThis is quite to White’s liking, since he wishes to advance Ids\r\ncentre pawns. Black’s only chance of escaping disaster would be:\r\nB-K2, with R-Q2, Kt-Q1-B2. Instead of this, his next few moves do\r\nnot reveal any concerted plan, and he loses in a surprisingly\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\n          17. P-B4          Q-Q4\r\n          18.

P-Q3 is not\r\nsatisfactory, for Black remains with a trebled pawn after the\r\ndouble exchange. An alternative to the text move is B-Kt3. Q-B3,\r\nhowever, has the advantage of developing a piece, and although it\r\nis the Queen, White has no early opportunity of driving the same\r\noff, such as he often obtains when the Queen comes out so soon in\r\nthe game.\r\n\r\n          6.

P-QKt3!\r\n\r\nOut of three possible moves, Lasker selects the one which\r\ncontributes most to development. B-Kt3 does nothing in that\r\ndirection, and BxB would bring the White Knight further into\r\nplay. The text move prepares the development of the B at Kt2 with\r\nthe option of Castles QR. If White exchanges Bishops he gives up\r\nthe command of his Q4.  Black’s P-Q3 might have had the same\r\nresult, but then the exchange would have given White a majority\r\nof pawns on the K side, whilst White’s three Q side pawns would\r\nhave held the black Q side pawns, one of the latter being\r\ndoubled.\r\n\r\n          8. Kt-Q2          Q-Kt3\r\n\r\nThe exchange of Bishops allows White to play Kt-K3, thus avoiding\r\nthe weakening move P-K Kt3. 9. B-KB4 is answered by P-Q4!.\r\n\r\n          9.

The pawn sacrifice is\r\nvery promising indeed.\r\n\r\n          13. ...              Q-B3\r\n          14. Castles          QxQBP\r\n          15.

There is every likelihood that the attack in the\r\npresent instance will lead to nothing.  It has taken many years\r\nto find the correct reply, but now that it is known, the opening\r\nhas practically disappeared from master practice. Instead of the\r\nmove in the text, White can play either P-Q3, leading almost\r\nunavoidably to a drawing variation of the Giuoco piano, or\r\nCastles which might bring about the Max Lange attack after 4. ...\r\nB-B4; 5.

Kt-B3 on account of\r\nBxKt; 14. PXB, P-B3 regaining the pawn and maintaining positional\r\nadvantage.

Now\r\ngames in which the Kings castle on different wings are more or\r\nless beyond calculation, as pointed out before. On the whole, the\r\nplayer who first attacks wins. But experience has shown that the\r\nQueen’s side is more difficult to defend on account of its\r\ngreater expanse, and this theory is supported by the present\r\ngame. In addition, White’s development is not completed yet,\r\nwhilst all the Black forces are ready to strike.\r\n\r\n          16. B-K3            Kt-Q2\r\n          17.

The intention is to break up the opposing pawn position,\r\nand to open files for the Rooks.

    "text": "\r\nThe idea underlying this pawn sacrifice is to open the K file for\r\nthe Rook. It will be seen that, with correct play, Black manages\r\nto castle just in time, and White, though winning back his pawn,\r\nhas no advantage in position. The opening is seldom played by\r\nmodern masters.\r\n\r\nInstead of the move in the text, White can hardly defend the KP\r\nwith Kt-B3, as Black simply captures the pawn and recovers his\r\npiece by P-Q4, with a satisfactory position.  It is even better\r\nfor Black if White plays 6. BxPch in reply to 5. ... KtxP. The\r\ncapture of White’s KP is far more important than that of the\r\nBlack KBP, particularly as the White Bishop, which could be\r\ndangerous on the diagonal QR2-KKt8, is exchanged, e.g. 6. ...\r\nKxB; 7. KtxKt, P-Q4; 8. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Kt1! Black continues P-KR3,\r\nK-R2, R-B1 and has open lines for Rooks and Bishops.\r\n\r\n          4. ...             KtxP\r\n\r\nBlack can, of course, develop his B-B4.

    "text": "\r\n  This attack has been analysed extensively by Steinitz.  The\r\nonly square where the Queen cannot be attacked at once by the\r\nminor pieces is at QI. After 8. ... Q-QI, Black obtains quite a\r\nsatisfactory game: 9. RxKtch, B-K2; 10. KtxP, P-B4. This is\r\nPillsbury’s move, intending to displace the Rook. Black has then\r\nopen lines for his two Bishops as compensation for his shattered\r\npawn position.  11. R-KB4, Castles; 12. KtxKt, QxQch; 13. KtxQ,\r\nPxKt. Now it is not easy to find a reasonable plan for White, as\r\nBlack threatens to cramp White’s game with B-Q3 and P-B5. It is\r\ntherefore necessary for White to take measures against that by\r\nplaying R-B4 and B-B4. If Black still plays B-Q3, B-B4 follows,\r\nwith the intention of exchanging and of provoking Black’s P-B4,\r\nwhich leaves the QP “backward.”\r\n\r\n          8. ...                 Q-KR4\r\n          9. KtxKt               B-K2\r\n         10. B-Kt5               B-K3\r\n         11. BxB                 KtxB\r\n         12. Kt-Kt3              Q-R3\r\n         13. QxP                 Castles KR\r\n         14. QR-Q1\r\n\r\nNow White is ahead with his development, having both Rooks in\r\nplay and his Queen better placed. Nor can the latter be attacked\r\nby R-Q1, as White would simply play QxR.  On the Queen being\r\ndriven away by the Black Knight, he exchanges the latter and\r\nplays the Queen back into the same dominating position,\r\neventually producing a dislocation of the Black Queen’s side\r\npawns.\r\n\r\n         14. ...                Kt-B3\r\n         15. Q-QR4              QR-Q1\r\n         16. Kt-Q4!             KtxKt\r\n         17. RxKt               RxR\r\n         18. QxR                P-QKt3\r\n         19. Q-K5               P-QB4\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to watch how this very slight weakness created\r\nby Black’s advance of his pawns brings him into trouble. A White\r\nKnight settles down at his Q6, which is no longer guarded by the\r\nBlack QBP, and paralyses the whole of Black’s game. Another\r\nfactor in White’s superiority of position is the possession of\r\nthe King’s file. The Black Rook cannot move until the King gets a\r\nloophole by a pawn move.  As we have seen, such a pawn move often\r\naffords an entry to the opposing pieces.\r\n\r\n         20. P-KB4              B-B1\r\n\r\nNot BxP, of course, because of P-QKt3 and Q-Kt2.  The Bishop\r\nwhich cannot remain at K3 is to go to Kt2, so that the threat of\r\nmate after Q-QB3 may also hold up a White piece.\r\n\r\n         21. P-B5               B-Kt2\r\n         22. Q-K7               Q-QB3\r\n         23. R-K2               P-B3\r\n\r\nCompulsory, as otherwise P-B6 forces the KtP to advance, which is\r\nfatal in any case. After P-Kt3, White would cover his BP and play\r\nhis Q to KR6. On the other hand, after PxP there is Kt-R5-B6, and\r\nBlack is in a mating net.\r\n\r\n         24. Kt-K4              Q-Q4\r\n         25. Kt-Q6              B-B3\r\n\r\nThe threat was QxRch and R-K8 mate.\r\n\r\n          26. P-KR3\r\n\r\nin order to retreat to R2 in case of Q-Q8ch. In a way P-KR3\r\ncreates a certain weakness, as the square at Kt3 is now\r\ndefenceless, but Black has no pieces with which to take advantage\r\nof it: his Rook cannot move, his Bishop is on the White squares.\r\nIf Black had a KB instead, the move would be very doubtful,\r\nbecause then Black might break in through White’s KKt3.\r\n\r\n          26. ...                P-B5\r\n\r\nWhite’s threat was to repel the Black Queen by P-B4 and to mate\r\nin five moves, beginning with Q-K6ch.\r\n\r\n          27.

    "text": "\r\n         8. ...              Castles\r\n\r\nIn Capablanca’s opinion Black should not castle before White’s\r\nintentions in the centre have been made clear. It makes a great\r\ndifference whether White plays his QP to Q4 or to Q3 only.\r\n\r\nIf after 8. ... QKt-R4; 9. B-B2, P-B4 White plays:  10. P-Q4, his\r\nintention is to move his pawn further to Q5 as soon as Black has\r\ncastled, and then to attack on the King’s wing with QKt-Q2-B1-K3,\r\nP-KKt4 and Kt-B5.  For this reason Black should force White to\r\ndisclose whether he intends to exchange his QP or to advance it\r\nto Q5. In the latter case Black can refrain from castling\r\naltogether and counter-attack on the King’s wing, e.g., 10. P-Q4,\r\nQ-B2; 11. P-KR3, B-Q2; 12. QKt-Q2, R-QB1; if now: 13.  P-Q5 then\r\nP-R3 followed by P-Kt4-Kt5 gives Black many chances. If on the\r\ncontrary 13. PxP, then Black need no longer fear an attack on the\r\nKing’s side after he has castled, as his Rooks will have a\r\nfavourable opportunity for operating on the open Queen’s file.\r\nHowever, there is still the disadvantage for Black of having\r\nadvanced Queen’s side pawns, which are liable to attack (P-QR4).\r\n\r\nThe game takes a different course when Black exchanges the pawns\r\nin the centre. The continuation would then be:  11. ... Kt-B3;\r\n12. Q Kt-Q2, B-Q2; 13. Kt-B1, PxP; 14. PxP, PxP; 15. B-Kt5, Q-\r\nKt3. It is difficult to decide which side has the advantage.\r\nBlack has an extra pawn, but White has the initiative.\r\n\r\nIf in Diag. 116, after 8. ... Castles White plays 9. P-Q4 at\r\nonce, Black has an opportunity for the following interesting\r\nattack: 9. P-Q4, B-Kt5; 10. B-K3, KtxKP; 11. B-Q5, Q-Q2; 12.\r\nBxKKt, P-Q4; 13. B-B2, P-K5 14. P-KR3, B-R4; 15. Kt-K5, BxQ; 16.\r\nKtxQ, BxB; 17. KtxR, RxKt. White cannot take advantage of his\r\nRooks, as there is no open file, whilst Black threatens to\r\ninitiate a strong attack with P-B4.\r\n\r\nAljechin has analysed a variation of this line of play, which he\r\nthinks leads finally to White’s advantage: 12. PxP, Kt-Kt4; 13.\r\nBxKt, BxB; 14. P-KR3, BxKt; 15. QxB, KtxP; 16. RxKt, PxR; 17.\r\nBxR, B-B8; 18. Kt-R3, Q-Q7. I doubt that White can win this game.\r\n\r\n          9. P-Q3\r\n\r\nIn this less aggressive continuation, in which nothing is\r\nimmediately attempted against Black’s centre, White prepares\r\ngradually for a King’s side attack, as in this game with Kt-Q2-\r\nB1-Kt3. But Black should obtain time for operations in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n          9. ...                Kt-QR4\r\n          10. B-B2              P-B4\r\n          11. QKt-Q2            Kt-B3\r\n          12. P-QR4\r\n\r\nIn many variations of the Ruy Lopez, this advance is always good,\r\nif Black cannot avoid exchanging the pawn, because the White\r\nQueen’s Rook, which only gets into play with difficulty, can\r\neither be exchanged or hold the Rook’s file. In any case the\r\nBlack Knight’s pawn is weak for the end-game. If, as in the\r\npresent game. Black can play P-Kt5, P-R4 is useless and even\r\ndoubtful, as the Rook’s pawn itself may become weak in the end-\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n          12. ...               B-Kt2\r\n\r\nThis causes the loss of the game. In the Ruy Lopez the Bishop is\r\nnearly always needed on the diagonal QB1-KR6, to prevent a Knight\r\nfrom settling at White’s KB5, which otherwise cannot be repelled\r\nexcept by P-KKt3, a most undesirable consummation. The proper\r\ncontinuation would have been P-Kt5, B-K3, Q-B2 and P-Q4,\r\ncapturing the Queen’s file. Compare note to move 13 in the next\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n          13. Kt-B1             Q-B2\r\n          14.

    "text": "\r\nThis is one of the most important positions in the Ruy Lopez.\r\nBlack has the better development, but his centre is less secure.\r\nWhilst White has a pawn secured in the centre, Black has a Knight\r\nthere which will soon be driven away.  White’s Q4, the basis of\r\nhis centre, is entirely in his hands, while Black’s Q4 is exposed\r\nto a steady pressure by the White pieces. Finally Black’s Q Kt is\r\nunfavourably placed, obstructing as it does the QBP and\r\npreventing it from falling into line with its fellows. In\r\nPetrograd, 1909, Lasker tried the following new defence: Kt-B4\r\nfollowed by B-Kt5, giving up the moves gained before in order to\r\nrelieve the pressure on the Black QP and to exchange the same\r\nultimately at Q5.  The various possibilities of the position have\r\nbeen discussed in connection with Diag. 22. It may be added that\r\nafter 10. ... Castles; QKt-Q2 is surely a better move than the\r\nusual Kt-Q4, as the Queen’s side should be developed before\r\nundertaking an attack (11. ... Q-Q2?; 12. KtxB, followed by\r\nRxKt). For a long time it was thought that after Kt-Q4 Black had\r\nto exchange Knights, which enables White to make the pawn at QB7\r\n“backward” by B-K3.  For Black must first play P-KR3 to guard his\r\nKt against the threat of P-B3 and P-KR4. However, a sensational\r\ninnovation which refutes the Kt’s move was introduced in Breslau\r\nin 1912. It is the following sacrifice:  10. ... Castles; 11. Kt-\r\nQ4, KtxKP!; 12. P-B3, B-Q3!!; 13. PxKt, B-Kt5!!; 14. Q-Q2, Q-R5\r\nwith an overpowering attack.\r\n\r\n         10. ...            Kt-B4\r\n         11. B-B2           B-Kt5\r\n         12. Q Kt-Q2        Castles\r\n         13. Kt-Kt3         Kt-K5\r\n\r\nHere Lasker played Kt-K3 against Janowski (Paris, 1912), but it\r\nproved to be inferior, because 14. Q-Q3 disorganises Black’s\r\nKing’s side forcibly.\r\n\r\nThe move in the text is not really a pawn sacrifice. After 14.\r\nBxKt, PxB; 15. QxQ, QRxQ; 16. KKt-Q4, KtxKt; 17. KtxKt, R-Q4,\r\nWhite cannot play 18. RxP, because of P-QB4; 19. Kt-B2, B-B4 or\r\n19. Kt-B3, R-Q8ch; 20. Kt-K1, B-B4; 21. R-K2, B-Q6; 22. R-K3, B-\r\nKt4.\r\n\r\n         14. B-B4           P-B4\r\n         15. PxP e.p.       KtxP(B3)\r\n         16. Q-Q3           Kt-K5?\r\n\r\nThis loses the QBP, and weakens the QP. Black might have tried\r\nBxKt; 17. QxB, B-Q3. It would then have been possible to support\r\nthe QP by P-B3 after moving the Kt away. If Black was anxious to\r\npreserve his two Bishops he would even have risked P-Kt3. After\r\n17. B-R6, R-B2, the Bishop could have been driven away again by\r\nthe KKt from Kt1 or Kt5. The open file offered some compensation\r\nand chances of counter attack.\r\n\r\n          17. BxP           Q-Q2\r\n\r\nNot QxB because of QxPch.\r\n\r\n          18. Kt-K5         KtxKt\r\n          19. BxKt          B-R5\r\n\r\nRxP is bad because of 20. RxKt, B-KB4; 21. Q-Kt3.\r\n\r\n          20. B-Kt3         BxB\r\n          21. RPxB          B-B4\r\n\r\nNow RxP! was feasible with a level game after: 22. RxKt, B-B4!\r\n23. KxR, BxR; 24. Q any, Q-B4ch, followed by BxB. After missing\r\nthis chance, Black soon loses the game.\r\n\r\n          22. Q-Q4          KR-Q1\r\n          23. QR-Q1         Q-QB2\r\n          24. Kt-Q2         KtxKBP\r\n\r\nA last and desperate attempt. Black obtains Rook and pawn against\r\ntwo minor pieces, but has no time to initiate an attack with the\r\nRooks. The wisest plan was to give up the P, with a view to\r\neffecting the exchange of the minor pieces, because an ending\r\nwith Queen and Rooks generally produces a draw. Black could not\r\nplay KtxKtP instead of the move in the text because of 25. B-\r\nKt3!.\r\n\r\n         25. BxB            KtxR\r\n         26. RxKt           QxKtP\r\n         27.

To be considered are P-\r\nB4 and B-KKt5. An argument against P-B4 is that White can deprive\r\nBlack’s weak centre pawn of one protecting piece (12. PxP e.p.,\r\nKtxP (B3); 13.

Neither\r\ncan 18. ... B-QB4 be played because of 19. B-Kt5, Q-B1; 20. B-B6.\r\nPreferable to the text move seems B-KB1 (19. B-Kt5, Q-B1; 20.

White, in possession of two Bishops, with an open\r\nQueen’s file on which the Black King stands, has good attacking\r\nchances, and most masters would think the position favourable for\r\nWhite.\r\n\r\n          14. ...                B-K3\r\n\r\nP-KB4 is a plausible move, but is followed by a pretty mate by\r\n15. B-Kt5. The move in the text threatens to eliminate the KB by\r\nP-QB4, P-QKt4.\r\n\r\n          15.

B-Kt6, thereby permanently preventing Black\r\nfrom contesting the Queen’s file, and then try to exchange\r\nBlack’s B by Kt-K2-Q4. With two Bishops, White would then have\r\nwinning chances.\r\n\r\nA subtle idea underlies White’s move of P-KKt4. He wishes to take\r\nadvantage of the fact that Black has exchanged the KB by playing\r\nP-Kt5, thus holding all the four pawns on the King’s side. But\r\nBlack finds a surprising reply, which seems to refute White’s\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nCapablanca played against Ed. Lasker (New York, 1915), 17. P-\r\nKKt4, P-KKt3; 18. K-Kt3, P-KR4; 19.

If\r\nWhite accepts the sacrifice, he loses his KKtP, and Black retains\r\nthree passed pawns for the piece, at least an equivalent for the\r\nend-game. White should decline the doubtful gift and meet the\r\nthreat of P-R3 and P-KKt4 with 19. R-KKt1.\r\n\r\n          19. B-Q4         P-R3\r\n          20. B-B6ch       K-B2\r\n          21.

    "text": "\r\nBlack allows his opponent too much latitude on the King’s wing.\r\nHe should prevent White’s P-B5, which obstructs his QB, by P-KB4.\r\nAfter P-K5 the game would be equalised by B-B4, BxKt, and B-K3.\r\n\r\nA draw would then be practically certain, with the Bishops of\r\nopposite colours. Black probably thought White would not risk\r\nweakening his KP by P-B5. But with unfailing judgment Lasker\r\nforesees that, in consequence of the greater mobility of his\r\npieces, his attack will be successful before a counter attack on\r\nthe weak KP can be instituted.\r\n\r\n          11.

    "text": "\r\nThis is the saving clause. If now Black had his B at B4, as White\r\nhas in the corresponding attack, White would first have to\r\nprotect his BP with 15 Q-K2, and would be lost after R-KKt1; 16.\r\nR-KKt1, R-Kt3; as 17. B-R4 fails because of Q-R6; 18. B-KKt3, R-\r\nB3; and on the other hand, after 17. RxR, PxR Black plays R-KB1,\r\nattacking the BP a second time.\r\n\r\nWith the Black Bishop at Kt5, however, Black does not succeed.\r\nThe continuation could be l5. ... R-KKt1; 16.  R-Kt3, R-Kt3; 17.\r\nB-R4, with a probable draw.\r\n\r\nThis line of play is most difficult for both sides, and it has\r\nbeen avoided so far in tournaments.\r\n\r\nIn Diagram 128 the favourite continuation for many years was: 7.\r\n... BxKt; 8. PxB, Kt-K2. The opening of the KKt file by 9. BxKKt\r\nis not to be feared, because of the reasons given when discussing\r\nDiagram 90. But White obtains the advantage with 9. Kt-R4,\r\npreparing the opening of the KB file by P-B4 and PxP. 9. ... Kt-\r\nKt3, in order to retake with the BP after 10. KtxKt and to open\r\nthe file for Black’s Rooks, is not a sufficient reply, because\r\nafter 11. P-B4 and PxP White has a clear advantage, having an\r\nextra pawn in effect for the end-game. For the three Black pawns\r\non the King’s side are held by the two adverse pawns, which they\r\ncannot pass.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to expel the troublesome Bishop after 9. ... Kt-K1 by\r\nP-KB3, and then play for a centre by P-B3, Kt-B2 and P-Q4 fails\r\non account of the withering attack which White obtains on the KB\r\nfile, e.g. 9. ... Kt-K1; 10. B-QB4, K-R1; 11. P-B4, P-KB3; 12. Q-\r\nR5, PxB; 13. PxP, etc.\r\n\r\nIn consequence the defence by 7. ... BxKt and Kt-K2 has been\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nIn the present game Black reverts to a very old defence,\r\ncomprising the moves: BxKt, Q-K2, Kt-Q1-K3. It had been abandoned\r\nbecause White, by playing R-K1, P-Q4, and eventually B-B1 and B-\r\nR3, forces the exchange of Black’s centre pawn, and obtains an\r\nadvantage, on well-known grounds. Here Black strengthens the\r\ndefence by interpolating P-KR3!, after which White must come to a\r\ndecision as to maintaining the pin. If he decides to do so the\r\nWhite Bishop will no longer be able to threaten the Black Queen\r\nfrom QR3.\r\n\r\n          7. ...                 BxKt\r\n          8. PxB                 P-KR3\r\n          9. B-KR4\r\n\r\nIf the B retreats to B1 or K3, Black can adopt the defence Kt-K2-\r\nKt3. Then Kt-R4 would be inferior, because Black can simply play\r\nP-KKt4. In this case the advance of the pawns is justified,\r\nbecause Black can bring his QKt to KKt3 and have practically one\r\npiece more on the King’s side, and good prospects for the attack\r\nwhich he can open with K-R2, R-KKt1, Kt-Kt3-B5.\r\n\r\n          9. ...                 Q-K2\r\n\r\nP-KKt4 would be premature. White would win at once by 10. KtxKtP,\r\nPxKt; 11. BxP, as he can attack the Knight a second time by P-KB4\r\nand PxP before Black can either protect it sufficiently or\r\nrelieve the “pin.”\r\n\r\n         10.

QxB                 Kt-K3\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to play for the gain of a pawn with P-KKt4 and\r\nPxP, e.g. 13. ... P-KKt4; 14. B-Kt3, PxP; 15. R-K1!, PxP; 16. P-\r\nK5, etc.\r\n\r\n         14.

P-B4,\r\nP-QR3), Black completes his development a little later (10. R-K1,\r\nP-KB3; 11. K-B1ch, K-B2), but after the exchange of Queens there\r\nis not much to fear from an immediate attack, and the value of\r\nthe two Bishops soon asserts itself. In a match game Ed. Lasker-\r\nCole (London, 1913) the continuation was 12. P-Q4, P-QR3; 13. Kt-\r\nB3, KtxKt; 14. PxKt, P-Q4. Here the doubled pawn is a\r\ndisadvantage, in that the pawn at B2 is immobile, and constantly\r\nliable to be attacked by B-B4. P-Q3 was the better move.\r\n\r\n          7. Castles         KtxKt\r\n\r\nNow KtxB was no longer possible. After KtxQKt there would be\r\nthreats of KtxBP as well as of R-K1 and P-Q3.

QxP!!\r\n\r\nBlack being behind with his development is already threatened by\r\nsacrificial combinations. If he takes the Bishop he loses by 15.\r\nB-Kt5ch, K-B1; 16. Q-Q8ch!, BxQ; 17. R-K8 mate, or l5. ... P-B3;\r\n16. BxPch, and so on.\r\n\r\n         14. ...             P-B3\r\n         15. Q-K4            B-K3\r\n         16. R-K3            B-QB4\r\n\r\nHere Black might have castled on the Queen’s side, but R-Q1 would\r\nhave had much the same sequel as in the actual game.\r\n\r\n         17. B-K5            Q-R3\r\n         18. R-Kt3           B-KB1\r\n\r\nA sorry retreat. But after Q-Q7, which may have been Black’s\r\noriginal intention, White plays R-KB1, threatening B-KB4.\r\n\r\n         19. R-Q1\r\n\r\nThis move completes White’s development, and only seems to give\r\nBlack a chance of castling. However, Black has no satisfactory\r\ncontinuation.\r\n\r\n         19. ...

B-K2\r\n\r\nThere was a threat of KtxB and KtxP. If Black plays P-Q3, the B\r\nmust retire all the same after 5. B-Kt5. It seems best to retire\r\nthe B to K2 rather than to B4 or R4, because there remains the\r\nthreat of a pin subsequently by B-KKt5, which might become\r\nserious with the Knight at Q5.\r\n\r\n          5.

This is\r\nsound strategy, since White has exchanged his QKt, which from B3\r\nprevents P-Q4 in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n          9. B-K3                Castles\r\n         10.

Q-Q2 to have been a lost move. But giving\r\nup the centre is a far greater evil. Black now commands his Q5\r\nand KB5, and this enables him to start an attack to which there\r\nis no defence.

BxKt           PxB\r\n\r\nIf the Queen recaptures, White obtains too great an advantage in\r\ndevelopment, and therefore Black submits to the doubling of his\r\npawns. It is doubtful if this means a handicap, although the\r\nKing’s side gets broken up. For Black keeps his two Bishops, a\r\npowerful weapon, unless White succeeds in developing swiftly an\r\nattack on the King’s side. The present game is instructive and\r\nshows the chances afforded to both sides by the position brought\r\nabout by the exchange at KB6.\r\n\r\n          6. KtxP           P-KB4\r\n\r\nAs the KB obtains a long diagonal at Kt2, this advance is\r\njustified. Otherwise there would be strong objections to it, as\r\nthe pawn is likely to be subjected to attack, and apart from\r\nthat, it gives up command of Black’s K4.\r\n\r\n          7. Kt-QB3\r\n\r\nKt-Kt3 would seem more natural, firstly, because Black has\r\nweaknesses on the K side, and White will need his pieces for\r\nattack in that quarter, and secondly, because the QP ought to be\r\nsupported by P-B3, as Black will attack it by B-Kt2.\r\n\r\n          7. ...

The isolated pawn resulting after 13. PxP is not to\r\nbe feared, as the B at Kt2 would have greater efficiency (QR-\r\nKt1), and White would not be so firmly established in the centre.\r\n\r\n         13.

If\r\nBlack can manage to play his King into safety at R1 in time, and\r\nthen occupies the Kt file with his Rooks, he would have the\r\nbetter of it, his pieces having by far the greater range of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n         14. ...

    "text": "\r\n          7. Kt-Kt5\r\n\r\nThe intention is to strengthen the centre by P-QB3.  Though it\r\ntakes a number of moves to bring the Knight into play again, yet\r\nmost of the tournament games in this variation have been won by\r\nWhite, mostly through a King’s side attack on the lines set out\r\nin the notes to Game No. 22.  Investigations by Alapin tend to\r\nshow that this is due to the fact that Black in all cases devoted\r\nhis attention to Queen’s side operations (just as in Game No. 22)\r\nwhen he could have utilised White’s backward development, by\r\nhimself starting a counter attack on the King’s side. He can then\r\neither aim at the White centre at once with P-KB3, or else play\r\nP-KB4 and prepare the advance of the KKtP by Kt-B3-Q1-B2.  These\r\nvarious lines of play are still under discussion. Simple\r\ndevelopment is probably preferable to the move in the text, e.g.\r\n7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. P-B4, P-QB4; 9. Kt-B3.\r\n\r\n          7. ...            K-Q1\r\n\r\nThere can be no advantage in forfeiting the option of castling\r\nunless there be no other way of getting the King into safety and\r\nof bringing the Rooks into concerted action. It is obvious that\r\notherwise the free development of pieces is hindered, and the\r\nKing is in appreciable danger, for it is easier to open files in\r\nthe centre than on the wings where the pawns have not advanced\r\nyet. Therefore Kt-Kt3 is the only move worth considering.\r\n\r\n          8. P-QB3           P-KB3\r\n          9. PxP\r\n\r\nWith the Black King remaining in the centre, White has no further\r\ninterest in the maintenance of his pawn at K5. On the contrary he\r\nwill try to clear the centre.\r\n\r\n          9. ...             PxP\r\n         10. Q-Q2            P-B3\r\n         11. Kt-QR3          Kt-B1\r\n\r\nAt this early stage it is clear that Black will have to contend\r\nwith difficulties in trying to complete his development.   The\r\nusual way (P-QB4) is barred on account of the dangers to Black’s\r\nKing with which a clearance in the centre is fraught.\r\n\r\n         12. Kt-B3           B-Q2\r\n         13. P-KKt3!\r\n\r\nAs Black can force this advance at any time by playing R-KKt1,\r\nWhite decides to develop his KB at Kt2, thereby covering his KB3\r\nand KR3. The weakness of the latter squares would not be of any\r\ngreat moment if White were to castle on the Queen’s wing. But as\r\nP-QB4 is necessary in order to break up the centre, castling KR\r\nis the right course.\r\n\r\n         13. ...                 B-K1\r\n         14.

    "text": "\r\nThis line of defence, called the McCutcheon variation, was\r\nrecommended for many years by Tarrasch as being the strongest.\r\nThe most obvious continuation 5. P-K5 leads to complications, and\r\nthe final verdict has not yet been reached.  After 5. ... P-KR3,\r\nthe best continuation is thought to be:  6. PxKt, PxB; 7. PxP, R-\r\nKt1; 8. P-KR4, PxP; 9. Q-R5, Q-B3; 10. QxRP, QxP.\r\n\r\nWhite has an easy development, whilst Black, as in most\r\nvariations in the French defence, finds it difficult to bring his\r\nQB into play. After P-KR3, it is not advisable to retire the\r\nBishop; 6. B-R4, P-KKt4; 7. B-Kt3, for here the Bishop is out of\r\nplay, and Black’s King’s Knight being free can play to K5 for\r\nconcerted action with Black’s KB.  Lasker’s continuation in the\r\npresent instance is at once simple and effective. It leads to an\r\nentirely different system of development.\r\n\r\n          5. PxP             QxP\r\n\r\nIf Black recaptures with the pawn, he must lose a move with the\r\nBishop in order to avoid getting an isolated doubled pawn after\r\n6. Q-B3. The doubled pawn which Black may get after the move in\r\nthe text would not be isolated, and therefore not necessarily\r\nweak. It could become a weakness if Black were to castle on the\r\nKing’s side.

P-QR4, a move\r\nwhich was necessary in any case, in order to develop the QKt via\r\nR3, this being the Knight’s only chance of getting into play,\r\nbecause, as long as the QP is attacked three times the lines of B\r\nand Q must not be interrupted. That is a weakness in White’s\r\ngame, and it was necessary for Black to prevent his Kt being\r\ndriven off by P-KKt4. P-KR4 was the correct move. Then White also\r\nhad to play P-KR4 to prevent P-KKt4-5, in which case Black could\r\nhave played l3. ... P-KKt3, and have brought his Rooks into\r\nconcerted action. P-KKt3 would have been necessary before\r\ncastling, because White’s B-Q3 would have attacked the KKt.

Black: Rubinstein.\r\n\r\n               Sicilian Defence.\r\n\r\n          1. P-K4          P-QB4\r\n\r\nAt first glance this move would seem to lose time, as it does\r\nnothing towards the main object of opening strategy, namely, the\r\ndevelopment of pieces. But we shall find that\r\n it does contribute to that aim, although indirectly. For one\r\nthing it could, by a transposition of moves, lead into an opening\r\nin which P-QB4 is played in any case; in other openings it is of\r\nuse, in that it acts from the first against the formation of a\r\nstrong white centre. Concurrently it prepares the opening of a\r\nfile for the Rooks.\r\n\r\n          2. Kt-KB3          Kt-KB3?\r\n\r\nBlack should not play Kt-KB3 as long as White’s P-K5 means the\r\nclear gain of a move. There are plenty of developing moves to\r\nchoose from.\r\n\r\nTwo systems of development can be followed by Black according to\r\nwhether the KB is to develop at K2 or Kt2. In the first case\r\n(compare Game No. 29) P-K3 is played. In the second case, the\r\nopening might take this course: 2. ... Kt-QB3; 3. P-Q4, PxP; 4.\r\nKtxP, Kt-B3; 5. Kt-QB3, P-Q3 (not P-KKt3 at once, because White\r\nwould exchange Knights and drive off the KKt by P-K5); 6. B-K3,\r\nP-KKt3, and B-Kt2. White’s position is superior, as he has a pawn\r\nin the centre in conjunction with greater mobility. Black will\r\nfind it difficult to bring his QB into play. Nevertheless his\r\nposition is compact and difficult to get at.\r\n\r\n          3. P-K5\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly Rubinstein had taken this move into account when\r\nplaying 2. ... Kt-KB3. His idea was to provoke the advance of the\r\nKP. The pawn at K5 is weaker than at K4, particularly as Black’s\r\nQBP prevents its natural support by P-Q4. Moreover Black’s Q4 is\r\nfree from interference by White. White refutes this ultra\r\nsubtilty by simple and straight-forward play, and he gets such an\r\nadvantage in development that his attack succeeds before Black is\r\nable to demonstrate any weakness in White’s game.\r\n\r\n          3. ...            Kt-Q4\r\n          4. Kt-B3          KtxKt\r\n          5. QPxKt          Kt-B3\r\n          6. B-QB4          P-Q3\r\n\r\nAfter 6 ... P-K3, 7. B-B4 would restrain the QP.\r\n\r\n          7. B-B4           PxP\r\n\r\nAt this early stage Black has no satisfactory means of\r\ndevelopment. The QP is attacked three times, and therefore the KP\r\ncannot move, nor can the KB be developed at Kt2.  B-Kt5, in order\r\nto play BxKt and PxP, is refuted by BxPch. The move in the text\r\nwhich brings about the exchange of Queens, but develops another\r\nWhite piece at the same time, is more or less forced. It is\r\ninstructive to watch how White’s advantage in development soon\r\nmaterialises.\r\n\r\n          8. KtxP          QxQch\r\n          9. RxQ           KtxKt\r\n         10.

Black’s plan in retaking with the\r\nQueen might be to castle early on the Queen’s side and attack\r\nWhite’s centre pawn by P-K4, and White must be on the alert\r\nagainst this plan, though it will not be easy for Black to put\r\nthe same into execution, because of the exposed position of his\r\nQueen. After 4. Kt-QB3, Q-QR4 is the only move which brings the\r\nQueen into momentary security, and even then Black must provide\r\nfor a retreat, as after White’s B-Q2 there would be a threat of\r\nan advantageous “discovery” by the Kt. P-QB3 provides such a\r\nretreat, but it bars the QKt from its natural development at B3,\r\nwhere the Kt could exert further pressure on White’s Q4. The QB,\r\ntoo, is difficult to get into play and easily becomes an object\r\nof attack, as in the present game.\r\n\r\n          4. Kt-QB3          Q-QR4\r\n          5. Kt-B3           B-B4\r\n\r\nB-Kt5 would only help White’s intentions to attack on the King’s\r\nside in the absence of Black’s Queen, e.g. 6. P-KR3, B-R4; 7. P-\r\nKKt4, B-Kt3; 8. Kt-K5 (threatening Kt-B4), P-B3; 9. P-KR4, Q Kt-\r\nQ2; 10. Kt-B4, Q-B2; 11. P-R5, B-K5; 12. KtxB, KtxKt; 13.

    "text": "\r\nThere seems to be nothing alarming about the position, yet on\r\ncloser investigation a number of vital failings can be discerned\r\nin Black’s camp. The absence of a pawn in the centre and the\r\nunsatisfactory development have a far-reaching influence.  White\r\nwill be able to bring his forces to the King’s side by way of K4,\r\nwhich is made accessible by the disappearance of Black’s QP,\r\nbefore Black has time to bring his QB to bear on White’s K4 by P-\r\nQKt3 and B-Kt2. White’s immediate threat (after P-K5) is Q-K2-K4\r\nand B-Q3.  If Black does not wish to risk P-KKt3, he must defend\r\nhimself with R-K1, Kt-B1. In the meantime White can play R-Q1 and\r\nthreaten P-Q5, opening the Queen’s file. This again necessitates\r\nP-B3, which postpones the efficiency of the QB at Kt2 until\r\nWhite’s QKt and QR have been brought up for the attack.

For one thing, it is rational to concentrate forces\r\nwhere the Queen can take her share, therefore, in this case, on\r\nthe King’s side. On the other hand, the manœuvre referred to\r\ncould not be put into execution here because Black can prevent P-\r\nR5 by P-QB4 and Kt-B3. A fairly obvious course was to play P-K4,\r\ntaking possession of the centre. P-QB4 would then be answered by\r\nP-Q5, after which the White Rooks would be very effective at Q1\r\nand K1.

Generally speaking it is wise, in R\r\nendings like the present one, to advance pawns on the side where\r\nthere is an extra pawn, in order to get a passed pawn as soon as\r\npossible.

    "text": "\r\nBlack’s difficulty is the development of his QB, particularly\r\nafter White’s last move, which prevents P-K4. If now Q-B2 White\r\nplays 9. P-K4 and either the Queen or the Knight bear on K5, e.g.\r\n9. ... PxKP; 10. KtxP, P-K4; 11. QKt-Kt5, B-Q3; 12. P-B5, etc.\r\n\r\nBlack therefore must develop his QB at Kt2 with P-QKt3, B-Kt2 and\r\nP-B4. Having moved the QBP twice, Black is a move behind the\r\ndevelopment usual in this opening.  However, it would have been\r\nthe lesser evil. In the present game the Bishop does not get into\r\nplay in time.\r\n\r\n          8. ...          PxP\r\n          9.

Kt-Kt5\r\n\r\nIf Black captures the pawn, White gains time by threatening the\r\nQueen, and brings all his forces into play, whilst the Black\r\nQueen’s side remains undeveloped, e.g.: 12. ... QxP; 13.   R-Q1,\r\nQ-B4; 14. Kt-Kt4, P-Kt3; 15. B-K3, Q-R4; 16. R-B1, with a strong\r\nattack. Black of course need not take the pawn, but the move in\r\nthe text is a valuable one nevertheless, as the threat Q-B3-R3\r\nprovokes a weakening pawn move.\r\n\r\n          12. ...       P-Kt3\r\n          13. KKt-B3    K-Kt2\r\n\r\npreventing the entry of the B at R6.\r\n\r\n          14. B-KKt5    QKt-Q4\r\n          15. QR-B1     B-Q2\r\n          16. Q-Q2      Kt-Kt1\r\n\r\nIt should be noted how the weakness at KR3 acts to the detriment\r\nof Black’s game. The text move covers the weak square, but at the\r\nsame time brings the Kt out of play. White in consequence gets\r\nthe upper-hand on the Queen’s side, and the Knight cannot return\r\nin time.\r\n\r\n          17. BxB       QxB\r\n\r\nIt would be no use taking with the KKt, as the threat Kt-Kt4 and\r\nQ-R6 must be guarded against. If the other Kt captures there\r\nfollows: 18. B-K4, R-Kt1; 19. R-B3 and KR-B1.\r\n\r\n          18. B-K4      B-Kt4\r\n\r\nThis drives the Rook to a better square, but already now there is\r\nno satisfactory move. It would perhaps have been best to parry\r\nthe threat of BxKt and R-B7 by playing Q-Q3, although the pawn\r\nwould have to recapture after 19. BxKt, because of 20. R-B5 and\r\nKR-B1. The chance of bearing on the QP through the open file,\r\nwhich was probably Black’s intention all along, would then be\r\nlost. After the text move, however, White takes possession of the\r\nseventh rank, and Black’s game collapses quickly.\r\n\r\n           19. KR-K1    Q-Q3\r\n           20. BxKt     PxB\r\n           21.

    "text": "\r\nBlack’s only plausible move here seems to be P-B4, and many\r\ncritics have remarked that after 11. P-K5, PxP!; 12. Kt-K4 (if\r\nPxKt, PxKt) KtxKt; 13. BxKt, R-QKt1; 14. BxB, QxB; 15. QxP, Q-B4;\r\nthe game would have been even. However, this is not the case, for\r\non the 15th move White does not capture the pawn with the Q but\r\nwith the Kt and Black has no satisfactory continuation. If he had\r\ncastled he could play l5. ... B-Kt2 which now is not available\r\nbecause of: 16. Kt-B6, BxKt; 17. BxB, with an overwhelming\r\nadvantage in position for White. White’s refutation of the text\r\nmove is above criticism.\r\n\r\n          11. PxP       Kt-Kt5\r\n          12. B-KB4     B-B4\r\n\r\nIf Q-B2, White would play R-B1, after which Black could not\r\nrecapture the KP yet, as the QBP is en prise.  13. ... KKtxP; 14.\r\nKtxKt, KtxKt; 15. Kt-Q5, Q-Q3; 16.

Black: Spielmann.\r\n\r\n           Irregular Opening.\r\n\r\n          1. P-Q4          P-QB4\r\n\r\nWith this move Black tries to avoid well-trodden paths of\r\ntournament practice. White can, at will, lead into a peaceful\r\nQueen’s Gambit by 2. P-K3 or into a Sicilian Defence by P-K4. It\r\nis more usual, however, to play P-Q5, which blocks up the Black\r\ncentre to some extent.\r\n\r\nIf 2. PxP, Black regains his pawn after P-K3 without any\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n          2. P-Q5          P-Q3\r\n          3. P-QB4\r\n\r\nCoupled with 4. P-K4, this move is of doubtful value, as Black\r\ngains command of White’s Q4. It is advisable to keep the QBP\r\nback, thus retaining the option of driving off a hostile piece\r\nfrom Q4 by P-QB3. Moreover, the White KB is hemmed in by the pawn\r\nat QB4.\r\n\r\n           3. ...       P-KKt3\r\n           4. P-K4      B-Kt2\r\n           5. B-Q3      P-K3\r\n\r\nThe development of the KKt is not desirable at B3, where it would\r\nblock the long diagonal. From K2, however, it commands KB4, where\r\nit can take up a strong position after the exchange of pawns in\r\nthe centre, or else it can support the advance of the KBP.\r\n\r\n           6. Kt-QB3    Kt-K2\r\n           7. KKt-K2\r\n\r\nKt-B3 would have been slightly better, because the Black QKt\r\nmight play to his K4.\r\n\r\n           7. ...       PxP\r\n           8. KPxP      Kt-Q2\r\n           9. P-B4\r\n\r\nThis move weakens the King’s position, and would be justified\r\nonly if there was a possibility of opening the file for the Rook\r\nby P-B5. But Black has too strong a hold on his KB4. The text\r\nmove aims at preventing the exchange of White’s KB through\r\nBlack’s Kt-K4. It would have been better to withdraw the B to B2.\r\n\r\n           9. ...       Kt-KB3\r\n          10. Kt-Kt3    P-KR4!\r\n\r\nNow White cannot enforce P-B5, as Black can attack the Knight by\r\nP-R5. White cannot prevent this with P-KR4, as the Black Knight\r\nwould take up a commanding position at Kt5. Black’s game is\r\nsuperior. He can concentrate all his minor pieces on the King’s\r\nwing, while White’s QB is ineffective on account of the ill-\r\nconsidered advance of the KBP.\r\n\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n     8 | #R |    | #B | #Q | #K |    |    | #R |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     7 | #P | #P |    |    | #Kt| #P | #B |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     6 |    |    |    | #P |    | #Kt| #P |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     5 |    |    | #P | ^P |    |    |    | #P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     4 |    |    | ^P |    |    | ^P |    |    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     3 |    |    | ^Kt| ^B |    |    | ^Kt|    |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     2 | ^P | ^P |    |    |    |    | ^P | ^P |\r\n       |---------------------------------------|\r\n     1 | ^R |    | ^B | ^Q | ^K |    |    | ^R |\r\n        ---------------------------------------\r\n         A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H\r\n\r\n",

P-KB4          P-Q4\r\n\r\nIt has been tried to refute White’s non-developing first move by\r\na pawn sacrifice: 1. ... P-K4; which leads to a rapid\r\nmobilisation of the Black forces after 2. PxP, P-Q3; 3. PxP, BxP.\r\nBut this attack--called the From Gambit--does not seem to prevail\r\nagainst the best defence. In a match game, Tartakower-Spielmann\r\n(Vienna, 1913), White won as follows:\r\n\r\n4. Kt-KB3, P-KKt4; 5. P-Q4, P-Kt5; 6. Kt-K5, Kt-QB3; 7. KtxKt,\r\nPxKt; 8. P-KKt3, P-KR4; 9. B-Kt2, P-R5; 10.

QxP, Q-K6ch; 22. K-B1,\r\nResigns.\r\n\r\nWhen Black plays P-KB4 in answer to 1. P-Q4 we have the Dutch\r\nDefence. After 1. P-Q4, P-KB4, White can also sacrifice a pawn by\r\n2. P-K4, and thereby obtain a far more favourable position than\r\nBlack does in From’s gambit, as he is a move to the good, having\r\nalready advanced his QP, e.g. 2. P-K4, PxP; 3. Kt-QB3, Kt-KB3; 4.\r\nP-B3 or 4. B-Kt5 and then P-B3. If Black captures the KBP, White\r\nobtains a powerful attack. A drastic example is found in the\r\nfollowing little game, played by two students in an academic\r\ntournament at Petrograd: 4. P-B3, PxP; 5. KtxP, P-K3; 6. B-KKt5,\r\nB-K2; 7. B-Q3, Castles; 8. Castles, P-QKt3; 9. Kt-K5, B-Kt2; 10.\r\nBxKt, BxB; 11. BxPch, KxB; 12. Q-R5ch, K-Kt1; 13. Kt-Kt6, R-K1;\r\n14. Q-R8ch, K-B2; 15. Kt-K5ch, K-K2; 16. QxPch!!, BxQ; 17. R-\r\nB7ch, K-Q3; 18. Kt-Kt5ch, K-Q4; 19. P-B4ch, K-K5; 20. R-K1 mate.\r\n\r\nBlack’s best answer is to play P-Q4 after White’s 4. P-KB3  (5.\r\nB-Kt5, B-B4). If 4. B-Kt5, it is not yet possible to play P-Q4\r\nbecause of the threat: BxKt, Q-R5ch, and QxQP. In that case Black\r\nmust first play P-QB3, after which White again obtains a strong\r\nattack by P-KB3.\r\n\r\nBlack can avoid the attacks which follow after 1. P-Q4, P-KB4; 2.\r\nP-K4, by playing P-K3 on his first move, and then lead into the\r\nDutch defence with P-KB4 on his second move. He must, however,\r\nreckon with having to play the French defence which White can\r\nbring about with 2. P-K4.\r\n\r\n          2. P-K3          P-K3\r\n          3.

B-Kt5         Kt-B3\r\n\r\nBlack should have played B-Q2 here, as White can exchange at B6,\r\nleaving Black with a doubled pawn. This in itself is not a\r\ndrawback, but in the present position it is serious, as Black\r\nwill have difficulty in finding a place for his QB. For there is\r\nno prospect of enforcing P-K4, as White commands that square in\r\nsufficient force.\r\n\r\n          6. B-Kt2          B-K2\r\n          7. Castles        Castles\r\n          8.

P-Q3           P-QR4\r\n\r\nBlack’s attempt of capturing his K4 by playing Kt-Q2 and P-B3,\r\nWhite would cross at once with Q-Kt4. With the text move Black\r\nbegins operations on the Q side, which is quite correct, as White\r\nhas the upper hand on the other wing.\r\n\r\n          11. Q-K2\r\n\r\nWhite should have prevented the further advance of the Black RP\r\nby 11. P-QR4.
